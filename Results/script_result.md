## INTRODUCTION

Modern humans act as powerful agents of ecosystem transformation. 
They have extensively and intentionally modified their environments 
for tens of millennia, leading to much debate about when and how the 
first human-dominated ecosystems arose (1). A growing body of ar-
chaeological and ethnographic evidence shows substantial, recursive 
interactions between foragers and their environments that suggest 
that these behaviors were fundamental to the evolution of our spe-
cies (2–4). Fossil and genetic data indicate that Homo sapiens were 
present in Africa by ~315 thousand years (ka) ago, and archaeolog-
ical data show notable increases in the complexity of behavior that 
took place across the continent within the past ~300- to 200-ka span 
at the end of the Middle Pleistocene (Chibanian) (5). Since our emer-
gence as a species, humans have come to rely on technological in-
novation, seasonal scheduling, and complex social cooperation to 
thrive. These attributes have enabled us to exploit previously un-
inhabited or extreme environments and resources, so that today hu-
mans are the only pan-global animal species (6). Fire has played a key 
role in this transformation (7).
Biological models suggest that adaptations for cooked food 
extend back at least 2 million years, but regular archaeological evi-
dence for controlled use of fire does not appear until the end of the 
Middle Pleistocene (8). A marine core with a dust record drawn 
from a wide swath of the African continent shows that over the past 
million years, peaks in elemental carbon occurred after ~400 ka, 
predominately during shifts from interglacial to glacial conditions, 
but also during the Holocene (9). This suggests that fire was less 
common in sub-Saharan Africa before ~400 ka and that by the 
Holocene, there was a substantial anthropogenic contribution (9). 
Fire is a tool that has been used by pastoralists to open and maintain 
grasslands throughout the Holocene (10). However, detecting the 
contexts and ecological impacts of fire use by Pleistocene early 
hunter-gatherers is more complex (11).
Fire is known both ethnographically and archaeologically as an 
engineering tool for resource manipulation, including improvement 
of subsistence returns or modification of raw materials, with these 
activities often associated with communal planning and requiring sub-
stantial ecological knowledge (2, 12, 13). Landscape-scale fires allow 
hunter-gatherers to drive game, control pests, and enhance produc-
tivity of habitat (2). On-site fire facilitates cooking, warmth, preda-
tor defense, and social cohesion (14). However, there is substantial

ambiguity regarding the extent to which fires by hunter-gatherers can 
reconfigure components of a landscape, such as ecological commu-
nity structure and geomorphology (15, 16).
Understanding the development of human-induced ecological 
change is problematic without well-dated archaeological and geo-
morphic data from multiple sites, paired with continuous environ-
mental records. Long lacustrine sedimentary records from the 
southern African Rift Valley, coupled with the antiquity of the 
archaeological record in this region, make it a place where anthropo-
genically induced ecological impacts may be investigated into the 
Pleistocene. Here, we report the archaeology and geomorphology of 
an extensively dated Stone Age landscape in southern-central Africa. 
We then link it to paleoenvironmental data spanning >600 ka to 
identify the earliest coupled evidence for human behavior and eco-
system transformation in the context of anthropogenic fire.

## RESULTS

Geochronology and geomorphology
We provide previously unreported age constraints for the Chitimwe 
Beds of the Karonga District that lie at the northern end of Lake 
Malawi in the southern portion of the African Rift Valley (Fig. 1) (17). 
These beds are composed of lateritic alluvial fan and stream deposits 
that cover ~83 km2, containing millions of stone artifacts, but do not 
have preserved organic remains such as bone (Supplementary Text) 
(18). Our optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) data from ter-
restrial records (Fig. 2 and tables S1 to S3) revise the age of the 
Chitimwe Beds to the Late Pleistocene, with the oldest age for both 
alluvial fan activation and burial of Stone Age sites ca. 92 ka (18, 19). 
The alluvial and fluvial Chitimwe Beds overlie Plio-Pleistocene 
Chiwondo Beds of lacustrine and fluvial origin in a low, angular 
unconformity (17). These sedimentary packages are in fault-bounded 
wedges along the lake margin. Their configuration indicates inter-
actions between lake level fluctuations and active faulting extend-
ing into the Pliocene (17). Although tectonism may have affected 
regional relief and piedmont slopes over an extended time, fault 
activity in this region likely slowed since the Middle Pleistocene 
(20). After ~800 ka until shortly after 100 ka, the hydrology of 
Lake Malawi became primarily climate driven (21). Therefore, 
neither is likely the sole explanation for Late Pleistocene alluvial fan 
formation (22).
Landscape stability after (Chitimwe) fan formation is indicated 
by formation of laterites and pedogenic carbonates, which cap fan 
deposits across the study region (Supplementary Text and table S4). 
The formation of alluvial fans in the Late Pleistocene of the Lake 
Malawi basin is not restricted to the Karonga region. About 320 km 
to the southeast in Mozambique, terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide 
depth profiles of 26Al and 10Be constrain formation of the alluvial, 
lateritic Luchamange Beds to 119 to 27 ka (23). This broad age con-
straint is consistent with our OSL chronology for the western Lake 
Malawi basin and indicates regional alluvial fan expansion in the 
Late Pleistocene. This is supported by data from lake core records, 
which suggest a higher sedimentation rate accompanied by increased 
terrigenous input after ca. 240 ka, with particularly high values at 
ca. 130 and 85 ka (Supplementary Text) (21).
Archaeology
The earliest evidence for human occupation in the region is tied to 
the Chitimwe sedimentary deposits identified at ~92 ± 7 ka. This 
result is based on 605 m3 of excavated sediment from 14 archaeo-
logical excavations with subcentimeter spatial control, and 147 m3 
of sediment from 46 archaeological test pits with 20-cm vertical 
and 2-m horizontal control (Supplementary Text and figs. S1 to S3). 
In addition, we have surveyed 147.5 linear km, emplaced 40 geological 
test pits, and analyzed over 38,000 artifacts from 60 of these localities 
(tables S5 and S6) (18). These extensive surveys and excavations show 
that while hominins, including early modern humans, may have in-
habited the region before ~92 ka, depositional aggradation associated 
with rising and then stabilized Lake Malawi levels did not preserve 
archaeological evidence until formation of the Chitimwe Beds.

The archaeological data support the inference that during the Late 
Quaternary, fan expansion and human activities in northern Malawi 
were substantial, and artifacts were of a type associated elsewhere in 
Africa with early modern humans. The majority of artifacts were 
created from quartzite or quartz river cobbles and featured radial, 
Levallois, platform, and casual core reduction (fig. S4). Morphologically 
diagnostic artifacts can be predominantly attributable to Levallois-­
type technologies characteristic of the Middle Stone Age (MSA), known 
to date from at least ~315 ka in Africa (24). The uppermost Chitimwe 
Beds, which continue into the Early Holocene, contain sparsely dis-
tributed Later Stone Age occurrences, found in association with 
terminal Pleistocene and Holocene hunter-gatherers across Africa. 
In contrast, stone tool traditions typically associated with the Early 
and Middle Pleistocene, such as large cutting tools, are rare. Where 
these do occur, they are found within MSA-bearing deposits dated 
to the Late Pleistocene, not an earlier phase of sedimentation (table 
S4) (18). Although sites are present from ~92 ka, the most well-­
represented period of both human activity and alluvial fan deposi-
tion occurs after ~70 ka, well defined by a cluster of OSL ages (Fig. 2). 
We confirm this pattern with 25 published and 50 previously un-
published OSL ages (Fig. 2 and tables S1 to S3). These show that of a 
total of 75 age determinations, 70 were recovered from sediment that 
postdates ~70 ka. The 40 ages associated with in situ MSA artifacts 
are shown in Fig. 2, relative to major paleoenvironmental indicators 
published from the MAL05-1B/1C central basin lake core (25) and 
previously unpublished charcoal from the MAL05-2A northern basin 
lake core (adjacent to the fans that produced the OSL ages).
Paleoclimate and environment reconstruction
Climate and environmental conditions coeval with MSA human occu-
pation at Lake Malawi were reconstructed using freshly generated 
data from phytoliths and soil micromorphology from archaeological 
excavations and published data from fossil pollen, macrocharcoal, 
aquatic fossils, and authigenic minerals from the Lake Malawi Drill-
ing Project cores (21). The latter two proxies are the primary basis 
of the reconstruction of relative lake depth dating back over 1200 ka 
(21) and are matched to pollen and macrocharcoal samples taken 
from the same places in the core that span the past ~636 ka (25). 
The longest cores (MAL05-1B and MAL05-1C; 381 and 90 m, respec-
tively) were collected ~100 km southeast of the archaeological project 
area. A shorter core (MAL05-2A; 41 m) was collected ~25 km east, 
offshore from the North Rukuru River (Fig. 1). The MAL05-2A core 
reflects terrigenous paleoenvironmental conditions of the Karonga 
region, whereas the MAL05-1B/1C cores did not receive direct 
riverine input from Karonga and thus are more reflective of region-
al conditions.
Sedimentation rates recorded in the MAL05-1B/1C composite 
drill core began to increase starting ~240 ka from a long-term aver-
age of 0.24 to 0.88 m/ka (fig. S5). The initial increase is associated 
with changes in orbitally modulated insolation, which drive high 
amplitude changes in lake level during this interval (25). However, 
when orbital eccentricity decreased and climate stabilized after 85 ka, 
sedimentation rates remained high (0.68 m/ka). This is concur-
rent with the terrestrial OSL record, which shows extensive evi-
dence for alluvial fan expansion after ~92 ka, and congruent with 
magnetic susceptibility data that show a positive relationship be-
tween erosion and fire after 85 ka (Supplementary Text and table 
S7). Given the error ranges of available geochronological controls, 
it is not possible to tell whether this set of relationships evolved 
slowly from a progression of recursive processes or occurred in rapid 
bursts as tipping points were reached. On the basis of geophysical 
models of basin evolution, rift extension and associated subsidence 
have slowed since the Middle Pleistocene (20) and, therefore, are 
not the primary cause of extensive fan formation processes we have 
dated to mainly after 92 ka.
Climate has been the dominant control of lake level since the 
Middle Pleistocene (26). Specifically, uplift in the northern basin 
closed an existing outlet ca. 800 ka, allowing the lake to deepen until 
reaching the sill elevation of the modern outlet (21). This outlet, 
located at the southern end of the lake, provides an upper limit on 
lake levels during wet intervals (including the present day), but 
allows the basin to close as lake levels drop during periods of aridity 
(27). Lake level reconstructions show alternating wet-dry cycles over

the past 636 ka. On the basis of evidence from fossil pollen, periods 
of extreme aridity (>95% decrease in total water volume) linked 
to lows in summer insolation resulted in the expansion of semi-
desert vegetation with trees restricted to permanent waterways (27). 
These (lake) lowstands were associated with pollen spectra showing 
high proportions of grass (80% or more) and xerophytic herbs 
(Amaranthaceae) at the expense of tree taxa and low overall species 
richness (25). In contrast, when the lake was near the modern level, 
vegetation with strong affinities to Afromontane forest typically 
expanded to the lakeshore [~500 m above sea level (masl)]. Today, 
Afromontane forests only occur in small, discontinuous patches 
above ~1500 masl (25, 28).
The most recent period of extreme aridity occurred from 104 to 
86 ka, after which open miombo woodland with substantial grass 
and herbaceous components became widespread, despite recovery 
of the lake level to high-stand conditions (27, 28). Afromontane 
forest taxa, most notably Podocarpus, never recovered after 85 ka to 
values similar to previous periods of high lake levels (10.7 ± 7.6% 
after 85 ka versus 29.8 ± 11.8% during analogous lake level before 
85 ka). Margalef’s index (Dmg) also shows that the past 85 ka has 
been marked by species richness 43% lower than during previous 
sustained periods of high lake level (2.3 ± 0.20 versus 4.6 ± 1.21, 
respectively), for example, in the high lake period between ca. 420 
and 345 ka (Supplementary Text and figs. S5 and S6) (25). Pollen 
samples from the period ca. 88 to 78 ka also contain high percentages 
of Asteraceae pollen, which can be indicative of vegetation distur-
bance and is within the error range of the oldest date for human 
occupation of the area.
Paleoenvironmental analysis
We use a climate anomaly approach (29) to analyze paleoecological 
and paleoclimatic data from the drill cores before and after 85 ka 
and test the hypothesis that the ecological relations among vegeta-
tion, species richness, and precipitation became decoupled from 
predictions derived from the presumably purely climate-driven 
baseline pattern of the preceding ~550 ka. This transformed ecologi-
cal system was influenced by both lake infilling precipitation con-
ditions and fire occurrence, as reflected in a species-poor and novel 
vegetation assemblage. Only some forest elements recovered after 
the last arid period, and these included fire-tolerant components of 
the Afromontane forest such as Olea, and hardy components of 
tropical seasonal forest such as Celtis (Supplementary Text and fig. 
S5) (25). To test this hypothesis, we model lake level derived from 
ostracode and authigenic mineral proxies as the independent vari-
able (21) versus dependent variables such as charcoal and pollen 
that could have been affected by increased fire frequency (25).
To examine how similar or dissimilar the assemblages were to 
one another at different times, we conducted a principal coordinates 
analysis (PCoA) using pollen from Podocarpus (evergreen tree), 
Poaceae (grasses), Olea (a fire-tolerant component of Afromontane 
forest), and miombo (the dominant woodland component today). 
By mapping the PCoA on top of an interpolated surface that rep-
resents lake level at the time each assemblage was formed, we examine 
how pollen assemblages changed relative to precipitation and how 
this relationship changed after 85 ka (Fig. 3 and fig. S7). Before 85 ka, 
samples dominated by Poaceae cluster toward drier conditions, 
while samples dominated by Podocarpus cluster toward wetter con-
ditions. In contrast, samples dating to after 85 ka cluster away from 
the majority of pre-85-ka samples and have a different average value, 
showing that their composition is unusual for similar precipitation 
conditions. Their position in the PCoA reflects the influence of Olea and 
miombo, both of which are favored under more fire-prone conditions. 
Of the post-85-ka samples, Podocarpus is only abundant in three suc-
cessive samples, which occurred just after the onset of this interval be-
tween 78 and 79 ka. This suggests that after initial rainfall increase, 
forests appear to make a brief recovery before eventual collapse.
To investigate the relations among the pollen, lake levels, and 
charcoal, we used a nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance 
(NP-MANOVA) to compare the total “environment” (represented 
by a data matrix of pollen, lake levels, and charcoal), before and 
after the transition at 85 ka. We found that variation and covaria-
tion found in this data matrix are statistically significantly different 
before and after 85 ka (Table 1).
Our terrestrial paleoenvironmental data from phytoliths and 
soils on the western lake margins agree with interpretations based 
on proxies from the lake. These show that despite high lake levels, 
the landscape had transitioned to one dominated by open canopy 
woodland and wooded grassland, much as today (25). All localities 
analyzed for phytoliths on the western margin of the basin date to 
after ~45 ka and show substantial arboreal cover that reflect wet con-
ditions. However, they suggest that much of that cover is in the form 
of open woodlands in cohort with bambusoid and panicoid grasses. 
On the basis of phytolith data, fire-intolerant palms (Arecaceae) were 
present exclusively by the lake shoreline and rare or absent from 
inland archaeological sites (table S8) (30).
In general, wet but open conditions in the later part of the Pleistocene 
are also inferred from terrestrial paleosols (19). Lagoonal clay and

palustrine-pedogenic carbonates from the vicinity of the Mwanganda’s 
Village archaeological site date between 40 and 28 cal ka BP (cali-
brated kiloanni before present) (table S4). Carbonate soil horizons 
within the Chitimwe Beds are typically nodular calcretes (Bkm) and 
argillic and carbonate (Btk) horizons, which indicate locations of 
relative landform stability with slow sedimentation derived from 
distal alluvial fan progradation by ca. 29 cal ka BP (Supplementary 
Text). Eroded, indurated laterite soils (petroplinthites) formed on 
remnants of paleofans are indicative of open landscape conditions 
(31) with strongly seasonal precipitation (32), illustrating the ongo-
ing legacy of these conditions on the landscape.
Support for the role of fire in this transformation comes from 
the paired macrocharcoal records from the drill cores, which from 
the central basin (MAL05-1B/1C) show an overall increase in char-
coal influx starting ca. 175 ka. Substantial peaks follow between ca. 
135 and 175 ka and 85 and 100 ka, after which time lake levels re-
cover but forest trees and species richness do not (Supplementary 
Text, Fig. 2, and fig. S5). The relationship between charcoal influx 
and magnetic susceptibility of lake sediments can also show patterns 
in long-term fire history (33). Using data from Lyons et al. (34), 
ongoing erosion of burned landscapes after 85 ka is implied at Lake 
Malawi by a positive correlation (Spearman’s Rs = 0.2542 and 
P = 0.0002; table S7), whereas older sediments show an inverse rela-
tionship (Rs = −0.2509 and P < 0.0001). In the northern basin, the 
shorter MAL05-2A core has its deepest chronological anchor point 
with the Youngest Toba Tuff at ~74 to 75 ka (35). Although it lacks 
the longer-term perspective, it receives input directly from the 
catchment from which the archaeological data derive. The north 
basin charcoal record shows a steady increase in terrigenous char-
coal input since the Toba crypto-tephra marker, over the period 
where archaeological evidence is most prevalent (Fig. 2B).

## DISCUSSION

Evidence for anthropogenic fire may reflect intentional use at the 
landscape scale, widespread populations creating more or larger 
on-site ignitions, alteration of fuel availability through harvesting 
of the understory, or a combination of these activities. Modern 
hunter-gatherers use fire to actively modify foraging returns (2). 
Their activities increase prey abundances, maintain mosaic land-
scapes, and increase pyrodiversity and succession stage heterogene-
ity (13). Fire is also important for on-site activities such as heat, 
cooking, defense, and socialization (14). Even small differences in 
the deployment of fire outside of natural lightning strikes can alter 
patterns of forest succession, fuel availability, and seasonality of 
ignitions. Reductions in arboreal cover and woody understory have 
the most potential to enhance erosion, while loss of species diversity 
in this region is tightly tied to loss of Afromontane forest commu-
nities (25).
Human control of fire is well established in the archaeological re-
cord from before the start of the MSA (15), but its use as a landscape 
management tool has only so far been documented in a few Paleolithic 
contexts. These include in Australia ca. 40 ka (36), Highland New 
Guinea ca. 45 ka (37), and ca. 50 ka at Niah Cave in lowland Borneo 
(38). In the Americas, anthropogenic ignitions have been implicated 
as major factors in the reconfiguration of faunal and floral commu-
nities as humans first entered these ecosystems, especially within the 
past 20 ka (16). These conclusions are necessarily based on correla-
tive evidence, but the argument for a cause-and-effect relationship 
is strengthened where there is direct overlap of archaeological, geo-
chronological, geomorphic, and paleoenvironmental data. Although 
marine core data offshore of Africa have previously provided evi-
dence of altered fire regimes over the past ~400 ka (9), here, we pro-
vide evidence of anthropogenic impacts that draw from correlated 
archaeological, paleoenvironmental, and geomorphic datasets.
Identifying anthropogenic fire in the paleoenvironmental record 
requires evidence of temporal or spatial changes in fire activity and 
vegetation, demonstration that these changes are not predicted by 
climate parameters alone, and temporal/spatial coincidence between 
fire regime changes and changes in the human record (29). Here, 
the first evidence for extensive MSA occupation and alluvial fan for-
mation in the Lake Malawi basin occurred alongside a major reor-
ganization of regional vegetation that began ca. 85 ka. Charcoal 
abundances in the MAL05-1B/1C core are reflective of regional 
trends in charcoal production and sedimentation that show sub-
stantial differences after ca. 150 ka when compared to the rest of the 
636-ka record (figs. S5, S9, and S10). This transition shows an im-
portant contribution of fire for shaping ecosystem composition that 
cannot be explained by climate alone. In natural fire regimes, light-
ning ignitions typically occur at the end of the dry season (39). 
Anthropogenic fires, however, may be ignited at any time if fuels 
are sufficiently dry. On a site scale, humans can alter fire regimes 
continuously through collection of firewood from the understory. 
The net result of anthropogenic fire of any kind is that it has the 
potential to result in more consumption of woody vegetation, con-
tinuously throughout the year, and at a variety of scales.
In South Africa, fire was used in the heat treatment of stone for 
tool manufacture as early as 164 ka (12) and as a tool for cooking 
starchy tubers as early as 170 ka (40), taking advantage of resources 
that thrived in ancient fire-prone landscapes (41). Landscape fires 
reduce arboreal cover and are crucial tools in maintaining grassland 
and forest patch environments, which are defining elements of an-
thropogenically mediated ecosystems (13). If modification of vege-
tation or prey behavior was the intent of increased anthropogenic 
burning, then this behavior represents an increase in the complexity 
with which early modern humans controlled and deployed fire in com-

avenue for understanding how human use of fire changed in the 
Late Pleistocene and what impacts these changes had on their land-
scapes and environments.
The expansion of alluvial fans during the Late Quaternary in the 
Karonga region may be attributable to changes in seasonal burning 
cycles under higher-than-average rainfall conditions, which result-
ed in enhanced hillslope erosion. The mechanism through which 
this occurred was likely by driving watershed-scale responses from 
fire-induced disturbance with enhanced and sustained denudation 
in the upper portions of the watersheds, and alluvial fan expansion 
in the piedmont environments adjacent to Lake Malawi. These re-
sponses likely included changes in soil properties to decrease infil-
tration rates, diminished surface roughness, and enhanced runoff as 
high precipitation conditions combined with reduced arboreal cov-
er (42). Sediment availability is enhanced initially by the stripping 
of cover material and over longer time scales potentially by loss of 
soil strength from heating and from decreased root strength. The 
stripping of topsoil increased sediment flux, which was accommo-
dated by fan aggradation downstream and accelerated laterite for-
mation on the fans.
Many factors can control the landscape response to changing 
fire regime, and most of them operate at short time scales (42–44). 
The signal we associate here is manifest at the thousand-year time 
scale. Analytical and landscape evolution models have shown nota-
ble denudation rate changes over thousand-year time scales with 
recurrent wildfire-induced vegetation disturbances (45, 46). A lack of 
regional fossil records contemporaneous with the observed changes 
in charcoal and vegetation records impedes reconstruction of the im-
pacts of human behavior and environmental change on herbivore 
community composition. However, large grazing herbivores that in-
habit landscapes that are more open play a role in maintaining them 
and in keeping woody vegetation from encroaching (47). Evidence 
of change across different components of the environment should 
not be expected to be simultaneous, but rather viewed as a series of 
cumulative effects that may have occurred over a prolonged period 
(11). Using a climate anomaly approach (29), we attribute human 
activity as a key driver in shaping the landscape of northern Malawi 
over the course of the Late Pleistocene. However, these impacts may 
be built on an earlier, less visible legacy of human-environment 
interactions. Charcoal peaks that appear in the paleoenvironmental 
record before the earliest archaeological dates may include an an-
thropogenic component that did not result in the same ecologi-
cal regime change that is documented later in time and that did 
not involve sedimentation sufficient to confidently indicate human 
occupation.
Short sediment cores, such as that from the adjacent Lake 
Masoko basin in Tanzania, or shorter cores within Lake Malawi 
itself, show changes in the relative pollen abundances of grass to 
woodland taxa that have been attributed to natural climate variabil-
ity over the past 45 ka (48–50). However, it is only with the longer 
perspective of the >600-ka pollen record of Lake Malawi, accompa-
nied by the extensively dated archaeological landscape next to it, 
that it is possible to understand the longer-term associations be-
tween climate, vegetation, charcoal, and human activity. Although 
humans were likely present in the northern Lake Malawi basin be-
fore 85 ka, the density of archaeological sites after ca. 85 ka, and 
especially after 70 ka, indicates that the region was attractive for 
human occupation after the last major arid period ended. At this 
time, novel or more intensive/frequent usage of fire by humans 
apparently combined with natural climate shifts to restructure a >550-
ka ecological relationship, ultimately generating an early preagricul-
tural anthropogenic landscape (Fig. 4). Unlike during earlier time 
periods, the depositional nature of this landscape preserved MSA 
sites as a function of the recursive relationship between environ-
ment (resource distributions), human behavior (activity pat-
terns), and fan activation (sedimentation/site burial).
The Anthropocene represents the accumulation of niche con-
struction behaviors that have developed over millennia, at a scale 
unique to modern H. sapiens (1, 51). In the modern context, an-
thropogenic landscapes persist and have intensified following the 
introduction of agriculture, but they are extensions, not discon-
nections, of patterns established during the Pleistocene (52). Data 
from northern Malawi show that periods of ecological transition 
can be prolonged, complex, and iterative. Transformations of this 
scale reflect complex ecological knowledge by early modern humans 
Fig. 4. Landscape evolution and ecology of the northern Lake Malawi basin. 
(A) ca. 400 ka: No detectable human presence. Wet conditions similar to today with 
high lake level. Diverse, non–fire-tolerant arboreal cover. (B) ca. 100 ka: No archaeo-
logical record, but human presence possibly detected by charcoal influx. Extremely 
arid conditions occur in a desiccated watershed. Commonly exposed bedrock, limited 
surface sediment. (C) ca. 85 to 60 ka: Lake level is increasing with higher precipita-
tion. Human presence archaeologically detectable after 92 ka and concentrated 
after 70 ka. Burning of uplands and alluvial fan expansion ensue. Less diverse, 
fire-tolerant vegetation regime emerges. (D) ca. 40 to 20 ka: Ambient charcoal 
input in the northern basin increases. Alluvial fan formation continues but begins 
to abate toward the end of this period. Lake levels remain high and stable relative 
to the preceding 636-ka record.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fieldwork survey, excavation, and profile documentation
Site survey and recording of artifact and cobble characteristics on 
survey tracts followed protocols described in Thompson et al. (53). 
Test pit emplacement and main site excavation, including micro-
morphology and phytolith sampling, followed protocols described 
in Thompson et al. (18) and Wright et al. (19). Our Geographic In-
formation System (GIS) maps based on Malawi geological survey maps 
of the region show a clear association between the Chitimwe Beds and 
archaeological sites (fig. S1). Placement of geologic and archaeological 
test pits in the Karonga region was spaced to capture the broadest 
representative sample possible (fig. S2). Geomorphic, geochronomet-
ric, and archaeological investigations of Karonga involved four main 
field approaches: pedestrian survey, archaeological test pitting, geo-
logical test pitting, and detailed site excavations. Together, these tech-
niques allowed major exposures of the Chitimwe Beds to be sampled 
in the northern, central, and southern parts of Karonga (fig. S3).
Site survey and recording of artifact and cobble character-
istics on pedestrian survey tracts followed protocols described in 
Thompson et al. (53). This approach had two main goals. The first 
was to identify localities where artifacts were actively eroding, and 
then place archaeological test pits upslope at those localities to re-
cover artifacts in situ from buried contexts. The second goal was to 
formally document the distribution of artifacts, their characteristics, 
and their relationship to nearby sources of lithic raw material (53). 
For this work, a crew comprising three people walked at 2- to 3-m 
spacing for a combined total of 147.5 linear km, transecting across 
most of the mapped Chitimwe Beds (table S6).
Work concentrated first on the Chitimwe Beds to maximize the 
sample of observed artifacts, and second on long linear transects 
from the lakeshore to the uplands that crosscut different sedimentary 
units. This confirmed the key observation that artifacts located be-
tween the western highlands and the lakeshore are exclusively asso-
ciated with the Chitimwe Beds or more recent Late Pleistocene and 
Holocene deposits. Artifacts found in other deposits are ex situ and 
have been relocated from elsewhere on the landscape, as revealed by 
their abundances, sizes, and degree of weathering.
Archaeological test pit emplacement and main site excavation, 
including micromorphology and phytolith sampling, followed proto-
cols described in Thompson et al. (18, 54) and Wright et al. (19, 55). 
The primary aim was to understand the subsurface distribution of 
artifacts and fan deposits across the larger landscape. Artifacts are 
typically deeply buried within the Chitimwe Beds in all places ex-
cept at the margins, where erosion has begun to remove the top part 
of the deposit. During informal survey, two people walked across 
Chitimwe Beds that appear as mapped features on Government of 
Malawi geological maps. As these people encountered the shoulders 
of Chitimwe Bed deposits, they began to walk along the margins 
where they could observe artifacts eroding from the deposits. By 
placing excavations slightly (3 to 8 m) upslope from actively erod-
ing artifacts, excavations could reveal their in situ locations relative 
to their containing sediments, without the necessity of laterally ex-
tensive excavations. Test pits were emplaced so that they would be 
200- to 300-m distant from the next-nearest pit and thus capture 
the variation across Chitimwe Bed deposits and the artifacts they 
contained. In some cases, test pits revealed localities that later be-
came the sites of full excavations.
All test pits began as 1 × 2 m squares, oriented north-south, and 
excavated in 20-cm arbitrary units, unless there was a noticeable 
change in sediment color, texture, or inclusions. Sedimentologic and 
pedologic attributes were recorded for all excavated sediment, which 
was passed uniformly through a 5-mm dry sieve. If deposit depth 
continued beyond 0.8 to 1 m, then excavation ceased in one of the 
two square meters and continued in the other, thus creating a “step” 
so that the deeper layers could be safely accessed. Excavation then 
continued until bedrock was reached, at least 40 cm of archaeologi-
cally sterile sediment had been reached below a concentration of ar-
tifacts, or excavation became too unsafe (deep) to proceed. In some 
cases, deposit depth required extension of the test pit into a third 
square meter, with two steps into the trench.
Geologic test pits had previously revealed that the Chitimwe Beds 
often appear on geologic maps because of a distinctive reddish color, 
when they include a wide range of stream and river deposits, alluvial 
fan deposits, and do not always present as red in color (19). Geologic 
test pits were excavated as simple pits designed to clean off mixed 
upper sediments to reveal the subsurface stratigraphy of deposits. This 
was necessary because the Chitimwe Beds erode as parabolic hillslopes 
with slumped sediments coating the slope and do not typically form 
clear natural sections or cuts. These excavations thus occurred either at 
the tops of Chitimwe Beds, where there was an inferred subsurface 
contact between the Chitimwe Beds and the underlying Pliocene 
Chiwondo Beds, or where river terrace deposits required dating (55).
Full archaeological excavations proceeded at localities that 
promised large assemblages of in situ stone artifacts, typically based 
on test pits or where artifacts could be seen eroding in large quan-
tities from a slope. Artifacts from the main excavations were recovered 
from sedimentary units that were excavated separately in 1 × 1 m squares. 
Units were excavated as spits of either 10 or 5 cm if artifact densities 
were high. All stone artifacts, fossil bone, and ochre were piece plotted 
at each main excavation, with no size cutoff. The sieve size was 5 mm. 
Artifacts were assigned unique barcoded plotted find numbers if they 
were recovered during excavation, and find numbers within the same 
series were assigned to sieved finds. Artifacts were labeled with per-
manent ink, placed in a bag with their specimen label, and bagged 
together with other artifacts from the same context. After analysis, all 
artifacts were stored at the Cultural and Museum Centre, Karonga.
All excavation was conducted according to natural layers. These 
were subdivided into spits, with spit thickness dependent on artifact 
density (e.g., spit thickness would be high if artifact density was 
low). Context data (e.g., sediment attributes, context relationships, 
and observations about disturbances and artifact densities) were re-
corded in an Access database. All coordinate data (e.g., piece-plotted 
finds, context elevations, square corners, and samples) are based on 
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates (WGS 1984, Zone 
36S). At main sites, all points were recorded using a Nikon Nivo 
C-series 5″ total station that was established within a local grid ori-
ented as closely as possible to UTM north. The location of the north-
west corner of each excavated site and the volume of sediment removed 
for each are given in table S5.
Profiles of sedimentologic and pedologic features were docu-
mented from all excavation units using the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture classification scheme (56). Sedimentologic units were 
designated on the basis of grain sizes, angularity, and bedding 
features. Anomalous inclusions and disturbances relative to the

sediment unit were noted. Soil development was determined on the 
basis of subsurface accumulation of sesquioxides or carbonates in 
the subsoils. Subaerial weathering (e.g., redox, residual Mn nodule 
formation) was also commonly documented.
OSL dating
Collection points for OSL samples were determined on the basis of 
an estimation of which facies were likely to yield the most reliable 
estimation of sediment burial age. At sample locations, trenches were 
made to expose authigenic sediment layers. All samples for OSL dating 
were collected by inserting light-tight steel tubes (approximately 4 cm 
in diameter and 25 cm in length) into the sediment profiles.
OSL dating measures the size of the population of trapped elec-
trons within crystals such as quartz or feldspar arising from exposure 
to ionizing radiation. The bulk of this radiation originates from the 
decay of radioactive isotopes within the environment with a minor 
additional component in the tropical latitudes coming in the form of 
cosmic radiation. Trapped electrons are released upon exposure of the 
crystals to light, which occurs either during transport (the zeroing 
event) or in the laboratory, where illumination occurs beneath a 
sensor (for example, a photomuliplier tube or charged couple de-
vice camera) that can detect photons emitted when the electrons re-
turn to their ground state. Quartz grains measuring between 150 and 
250 m were isolated through sieving, acid treatments and density 
separations, and analyzed either as small aliquots (<100 grains) 
mounted to the surface of aluminum disks or as single grains held 
within 300 by 300 mm wells drilled into an aluminum disc. Burial 
doses were typically estimated using single aliquot regeneration 
methods (57). In addition to assessment of the radiation dose received 
by grains, OSL dating also requires estimation of the dose rate through 
measurements using gamma spectrometry or neutron activation anal-
ysis of radionuclide concentrations within the sediments from which 
the sample was collected, along with determination of a cosmic dose 
rate by reference to the sample location and burial depth. Final age 
determination is achieved by dividing the burial dose by the dose rate. 
However, statistical modeling is required to determine an appropriate 
burial dose to use when there is a variation in the doses measured for 
individual grains or groups of grains. Burial doses were calculated 
here using the Central Age Model, in the case of single aliquot dating, 
or the finite mixture model in the case of single grain dating (58).
Three separate laboratories performed OSL analysis for this 
study. Detailed individual methods for each laboratory are presented 
below. In general, we applied OSL dating using regenerative-dose 
methods to small aliquots (tens of grains) rather than using single 
grain analysis. This is because small aliquots of samples had low 
recuperation ratios (<2%) during regenerative growth experiments 
and the OSL signals were not saturated at the levels of natural sig-
nals. Interlaboratory consistency of age determinations, consistent 
harmony of results within and between stratigraphic sections tested, 
and parity with geomorphic interpretations of 14C ages from car-
bonates were the primary basis of this assessment. Single grain proto-
cols were evaluated or performed at each laboratory, but independently 
determined to be inappropriate for use in this study. Detailed meth-
ods and analytical protocols followed by individual laboratories are 
provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Lithic analysis
Lithic artifacts recovered from controlled excavations (BRU-I; CHA-I, 
CHA-II, and CHA-III; MGD-I, MGD-II, and MGD-III; and SS-I) 
were analyzed and described according to metric and qualitative 
characteristics. Weight and maximum dimension were measured for 
each artifact (weight was measured to 0.1 g using a digital scale; all 
dimensions measured to 0.01 mm with Mitutoyo digital calipers). 
All artifacts were also classified according to raw material (quartz, 
quartzite, chert, and other), grain size (fine, medium, and coarse), 
grain size homogeneity, color, cortex type and coverage, weathering/
edge rounding, and technological class (complete or fragmentary 
core or flake, flake piece/angular shatter, hammerstone, manuport, 
and other).
Cores were measured along their maximum length; maximum 
width; width at 15, 50, and 85% of length; maximum thickness; and 
thickness at 15, 50, and 85% of length. Measurements were also ta­
ken to assess the volumetric attributes of hemispherically organized 
(radial and Levallois) cores. Both complete and broken cores were 
classified according to reduction method (single or multiplatform, 
radial, Levallois, and other), and flake scars were counted at both 
≥15 mm and at ≥20% of core length. Cores with five or fewer scars 
15 mm were classified as “casual.” Cortex coverage was recorded for 
the total core surface, and on hemispherically organized cores, the 
relative cortex coverage was recorded for each side.
Flakes were measured along their maximum length; maximum 
width; width at 15, 50, and 85% of length; maximum thickness; and 
thickness at 15, 50, and 85% of length. Fragmentary flakes were de-
scribed according to the portion preserved (proximal, medial, dis-
tal, split right, and split left). Elongation was calculated by dividing 
maximum length by maximum width. Platform width, thickness, 
and exterior platform angle were measured on complete flakes and 
proximal flake fragments, and platforms were classified according 
to degree of preparation. Cortex coverage and location were recorded 
on all flakes and fragments. Distal edges were classified according to 
termination type (feather, hinge, and overshot). On complete flakes, 
the number and orientation of prior flake scars were recorded. 
When encountered, retouch location and invasiveness were recorded 
following the protocol established by Clarkson (59). Refitting pro-
grams were initiated for most of the excavated assemblages to assess 
reduction methods and site depositional integrity.
Lithic artifacts recovered from test pits (CS-TP1-21, SS-TP1-16, 
and NGA-TP1-8) were described according to a simpler scheme than 
those from controlled excavations. For each artifact, the following 
characteristics were recorded: raw material, grain size, cortex coverage, 
size class, weathering/edge damage, technological component, and 
preserved portion of fragmentary pieces. Descriptive notes were 
recorded for diagnostic features of flakes and cores.
Micromorphology and carbonate dating
Intact blocks of sediment were cut from profiles exposed in excava-
tions and geological trenches. These blocks were stabilized in the 
field, using either plaster-of-Paris bandages or toilet paper and 
packaging tape, and transported to the Geoarchaeology Laboratory 
at the University of Tübingen, Germany. There, the samples were 
dried at 40°C for at least 24 hours. They were then indurated under 
vacuum, using a mixture of unpromoted polyester resin and styrene 
at a ratio of 7:3. Methyethylketone peroxide was used as the catalyst, 
with resin-styrene mixture (3 to 5 ml/liter). Once the resin mixture 
had gelled, the samples were heated at 40°C for at least 24 hours to 
completely harden the mixture. The hardened samples were cut 
with a tile saw into chips measuring 6 × 9 cm, which were glued to 
a glass slide and ground to a thickness of 30 m. The resulting thin

sections were scanned using a flatbed scanner and analyzed under 
the naked eye and under magnification (×50 to ×200) using plane-­
polarized light, cross-polarized light, oblique incident light, and blue-­
light fluorescence. Terminology and descriptions of the thin sections 
follow guidelines published by Stoops (60) and Courty et al. (61). 
Pedogenic carbonate nodules, collected from a depth of >80 cm, were 
sliced in half so that one half could be impregnated and studied in 
thin section (4.5 × 2.6 cm), using standard stereoscopic and petro-
graphic microscopes, as well as cathodoluminescence (CL) micros-
copy. Control on the type of carbonate was given much care, as 
pedogenic carbonates form in connection to a stable ground surface, 
while groundwater carbonates form independently from a ground 
surface or soil.
Samples were drilled from the cut faces of pedogenic carbonate 
nodules, which were halved to be used for various analyses. The 
thin sections were studied by F.S. with standard stereo and petro-
graphic microscopes of the working group for geoarchaeology and 
with a CL microscope at the working group for experimental min-
eralogy, both in Tübingen, Germany. Subsamples for radiocarbon 
dating were drilled with a precision drill from designated areas of 
ca. 3 mm in diameter in the opposing half of the nodule, avoiding 
zones with late recrystallization, abundant mineral inclusions, or 
great variability in calcite crystal sizes. The same protocol could not 
be followed for samples MEM-5038, MEM-5035, and MEM-5055 A, 
which were selected from loose sediment samples and too small to 
be cut in half for thin sectioning. However, corresponding micro-
morphological samples of the adjacent sediment, including carbon-
ate nodules, were studied in thin section.
We submitted samples for 14C dating to the Center for Applied 
Isotope Studies (CAIS), at the University of Georgia, Athens, USA. The 
carbonate samples were reacted with 100% phosphoric acid in evac-
uated reaction vessels to produce CO2. CO2 samples were cryogen-
ically purified from the other reaction products and catalytically 
converted to graphite. Graphite 14C/13C ratios were measured using 
a 0.5-MeV accelerator mass spectrometer. The sample ratios were 
compared to the ratio measured from the oxalic acid I standard 
(NBS SRM 4990). Carrara marble (IAEA C1) was used as the back-
ground, and travertine (IAEA C2) was used as a secondary stan-
dard. The results are presented as percent modern carbon, and the 
quoted uncalibrated dates are given in radiocarbon years before 
1950 (years BP), using the 14C half-life of 5568 years. The error is 
quoted as 1- and reflects both statistical and experimental errors. 
The dates have been corrected for isotope fractionation based on 
the isotope-ratio mass spectrometry–measured 13C values reported 
by C. Wissing at the laboratory for Biogeology in Tübingen, Germany, 
except in the case of UGAMS-35944r, which was measured at 
CAIS. Sample 6887B was analyzed in duplicate. A second subsam-
ple was drilled from the nodule for this purpose (UGAMS-35944r) 
from the sampling region indicated on the cut surface. All samples 
were corrected for atmospheric fractionation of 14C to 2- using the 
southern hemisphere application of the INTCAL20 calibration 
curve (table S4) (62).
Phytolith analysis
Sample (sediment, 0.7 g) was mixed with 0.1% preboiled solution of 
sodium hexametaphosphate Na6[(PO3)6] and sonicated (5 min). Orbital 
shaking took place overnight at 200 rpm. After clay dispersal, 3 N hydro-
chloric and nitric acids (HCl) (HNO3) plus hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
were added. Then, sodium polytungstate (3Na2WO4·9WO3·H2O) 
(Poly-Gee) at specific gravity 2.4 (preboiled) separated out phytoliths. 
This was followed by rinsing and centrifugation of samples at 
3000 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots (15 l) were mounted on boiled micro-
scope slides with Entellan New (cover, 20 × 40 mm = inspected area). 
System microscopy was performed at 40× (Olympus BX41, Motic 
BA410E). Classification nomenclature followed the International 
Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (63). The referential baseline 
included modern plants from several African ecoregions (64) and 
local soils (65), as well as archaeological localities in the Malawi 
basin (19, 66).
Statistical methods
The OSL data from the landscape and paleoecological data from the 
Lake Malawi 1B/1C core were subjected to statistical analyses to ex-
amine how they changed before and after ~85 ka. Kernel density 
estimates (KDEs) of sedimentation were constructed following pro-
tocols developed in Vermeesch (67) and Kappler et al. (68) from 
72 luminescence ages interpreted as originating from alluvial fan 
deposits (tables S1 to S3). KDEs provide reliable distributions of age 
occurrences when standard errors (SEs) overlap or the analytical im-
precision of the true age is high (67). For the present analysis, each 
age was replotted 10,000 times along a normal distribution using the 
rnorm command in R based on the laboratory generated mean and 
1- SE. The KDE was created in the “kde1d” package in R (69). 
Bandwidth was set to default, with data-derived parameters devel-
oped by Sheather and Jones (70).
To characterize the biotic environment, we used proportions of 
pollen from Poaceae, Podocarpus, miombo, and Olea. We used lake 
levels to characterize the abiotic environment. Over the ~636 ka 
span of the MAL05-1B/1C core for which pollen data are available, 
there have been several periods when lake level was equivalent to 
modern conditions. We have defined these analogous conditions by 
downsampling the published lake level data (21) to fit the pollen 
sample intervals (25), and then calculating the statistical mean of the 
principal components analysis (PCA) eigenvalue for all lake level 
proxies over the past 74 ka to represent “modern-like” lake conditions. 
The pollen sampling intervals effectively make this the statistical mean 
of lake levels between 21.4 and 56.2 ka [−0.130- and −0.198- (25)] 
and enable us to compare recent vegetation composition to its com-
position during older, analogous precipitation regimes.
To evaluate whether there were differences in the regional 
environmental structure before and after 85 ka, we conducted a 
NP-MANOVA (71). However, vegetation and lake level proxies are 
inherently different data types [pollen proportions (25) and the first 
principal component of all lake level proxies (21), respectively]. To 
conduct the MANOVA, these data must be the same type. Pollen, 
lake level proxies, and macrocharcoal were also sampled at different 
densities and intervals in the cores. To properly adjust the data so 
that once a single pollen sample and its age are matched to a single 
charcoal and lake level sample, we conducted a series of transforma-
tions. Because the pollen data were the most sparsely sampled, we 
used a spline to fit and downsample the lake level and charcoal data 
to match them. To make the pollen and lake level data equivalent, 
we conducted a PCoA using R software (72). PCoA is similar to the 
widely known PCA in that PCoA conducts a decomposition of a 
data matrix to obtain eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvec-
tors. The difference is that while PCA decomposes the variance-­
covariance matrix, PCoA solves for the eigenvalues of a distance 
matrix of the original data. To create the distance matrix, we used

the 2 distance, which is appropriate for proportion data, like pollen. 
The PCoA results in a set of scores, representing the original data, 
which can be plotted similar to PCA. In our case, these scores are 
not only useful for graphic illustration, but as they are normalized 
and Euclidean, they are identical to the lake level data and maintain 
all information contained by the original pollen dataset. This proce-
dure allowed us to use the PCoA pollen scores in conjunction with 
lake level variable in the NP-MANOVA to test whether there was a 
difference in environment before and after 85 ka. For the Supple-
mentary Materials statistics, biplots of species richness and lake level 
were constructed using the “ggplot2” package of R. Box and whiskers 
quartiles used the “boxplot” command in base R.
