## Introduction

Snow avalanches are a serious threat that destroys property
and claims the lives of people in mountainous regions around
the world every year. While catastrophic avalanches hitting
mountain villages are responsible for the largest number of
fatalities in mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, most
avalanche deaths in highly developed countries involve in-
dividuals heading into avalanche terrain for recreation. In
North America, for example, avalanches claimed the lives
of 334 recreationists between 2011 and 2020 (Avalanche
Canada, 2019; CAIC, 2020), and even though there are no
reliable statistics, it is suspected that many more recreation-
ists are caught in avalanches but manage to escape the most
severe outcome. While a small number of affected individu-
als were guides or ski patrollers professionally managing the
avalanche risk for paying guests or clients, the vast majority
were laypeople making their own decisions about when and
where to engage in winter backcountry recreation.
When travelling in the backcountry, avalanche risk is ide-
ally managed by carefully assessing the nature and severity
of the hazard using weather, snowpack, and avalanche ob-
servations (e.g., McClung, 2002). This assessment must be
combined with additional information about the terrain ex-
posure of an intended backcountry trip to the avalanche haz-
ard to make an informed decision about whether going ahead
with a trip is acceptable to the individual under the observed
conditions. Under most circumstances, recreationists are re-

sponsible for completing this complex assessment without
professional guidance. To assist recreationists with under-
standing the existing avalanche hazard conditions and mak-
ing these assessments, most highly developed countries have
established avalanche warning services that publish daily
condition reports, commonly known as avalanche bulletins,
forecasts, warnings, or advisories, that summarize the current
snowpack and avalanche situation across predeﬁned forecast
areas. These reports are intended to give recreationists the in-
formation needed to make an informed risk assessment of a
planned backcountry trip.
While the speciﬁc design of avalanche bulletins differs
from country to country, most of them present the infor-
mation in a tiered structure that is referred to as the “in-
formation pyramid” (EAWS, 2021). At the top of the pyra-
mid is the avalanche danger rating, the most abstracted tier,
which describes the overall severity of the avalanche condi-
tions using the signal words and colours of the ordinal, ﬁve-
level avalanche danger scale. The ﬁve-level scale was intro-
duced in 1993, and while there are subtle differences between
the European and North American versions (EAWS, 2018;
Statham et al., 2010), it is the cornerstone of public avalanche
risk communication around the world. The next level of the
information pyramid describes the nature of the avalanche
hazard in more detail. Over the last decade, the concept of
avalanche problems has established itself as a useful frame-
work for explaining the nature of avalanche hazard in a struc-
tured way. Avalanche problems represent actual avalanche
risk management concerns that can be described in terms
of their type, location, likelihood, and size of avalanches. In
North America, the conceptual model of avalanche hazard
(Statham et al., 2018a) deﬁnes nine different avalanche prob-
lem types, and avalanche bulletins describe the nature of up
to three active avalanche problems using a combination of
iconic graphics and text. European avalanche warning ser-
vices utilize a smaller list of avalanche problem types (called
avalanche problems in Europe) and use a range of approaches
to explain the location and nature of the present problems
– though, overall, the approaches tend to be similar to the
conceptual model of avalanche hazard. The next level of the
information pyramid provides users with more detailed, but
still synthesized, overviews of existing weather conditions,
relevant snowpack structures, and avalanche activity obser-
vations. Some avalanche warning services also include links
to raw data such as weather, snow proﬁle, or avalanche ob-
servations in their bulletins. These observations are the foun-
dation of the hazard assessment presented in the bulletin and
represent the ﬁnal and least abstracted level of the informa-
tion pyramid. The intent of the pyramid is to present infor-
mation about a complex hazard in an easily accessible and
concise way while allowing users with greater information
needs and more advanced skills to explore more details.
Avalanche warning services belong to a wider range of
warning services and government agencies whose mandate
is to communicate information about a complex and spa-
tially variable natural hazard to the public in a meaningful
way. Weather forecasters and local governments routinely is-
sue statements to communities faced with ﬁre, ﬂood, or storm
watches and warnings. In these disciplines, considerable at-
tention has been paid to improving risk communication prod-
ucts by testing which elements of risk communication mes-
sages are effective and which may lead to unintended con-
sequences (see, e.g., Cuite et al., 2017; Morss et al., 2016;
Rickard et al., 2017). For example, research into storm surge
messaging identiﬁed that recipients who saw messages about
extreme storm surges were more likely to express intentions
to evacuate but also were more likely to rate the informa-
tion as more overblown and the source as less reliable (Morss
et al., 2016). Similar efforts to empirically test the effective-
ness of warning messages and safety signage are underway
in the outdoor recreation ﬁeld (e.g., Saunders et al., 2019;
Weiler et al., 2015) to provide managers with evidence-based
guidance on how to communicate with their visitors.
Recognizing the crucial importance of the avalanche
bulletin for the safety of backcountry recreationists, the
avalanche safety community has recently started to exam-
ine its effectiveness more systematically. These efforts can
be divided into three main research themes. Several re-
cent projects have examined the quality and consistency of
the information presented in avalanche bulletins, as provid-
ing accurate hazard information is crucial for effective risk
communication (Lundgren and McMakin, 2018). Example
studies of this research theme include Lazar et al. (2016),
who presented public avalanche forecasters with a series
of avalanche danger scenarios to see whether they interpret
them in the same way, Techel et al. (2018), who examined
the spatial consistency and bias of avalanche danger rat-
ings in avalanche bulletins in the European Alps, Statham
et al. (2018b), who studied the consistency of avalanche
problem assessments among the warning services in the
Canadian Rocky Mountains, Clark (2019), who studied the
link between avalanche problem assessments and danger rat-
ings in Canadian avalanche bulletins, and Hutter et al. (2021),
who investigated the relationship between danger descrip-
tions and avalanche danger ratings in Swiss avalanche fore-
casts. All of these studies highlighted considerable chal-
lenges and the need to improve the production of avalanche
bulletins.
The second and equally important research theme is try-
ing to better understand how backcountry recreationists use
and apply the information provided in the avalanche bulletin.
The risk communication research community has stressed for
a long time that having a good understanding of the target
audience is a critical prerequisite for effective risk commu-
nication (Lundgren and McMakin, 2018). Traditionally, the
avalanche safety community has classiﬁed avalanche bulletin
users simply according to their preferred activity (e.g., back-
country skiing, mountain snowmobiling, and snowshoeing),
level of formal avalanche awareness training (none, introduc-
tory course, advance level course, or professional level train-

ing), and/or basic sociodemographics. Winkler and Techel
(2014), for example, used data from two online surveys to
determine who uses the Swiss avalanche bulletin and how
these users have changed over time. More recently, St. Clair
(2019) conducted a qualitative interview study to better un-
derstand how winter backcountry recreationists use, under-
stand, and apply the avalanche bulletin information in their
avalanche risk management process. Her analysis revealed
a sequence of ﬁve distinct bulletin information use patterns
that incorporate increasingly more complex information and
are able to manage avalanche risk at higher levels of sophis-
tication. This typology provides a valuable framework for
evaluating the effectiveness of risk messages with respect to
the types of decisions that the users are intending to make.
St. Clair’s (2019) study was followed up by Finn (2020), who
conducted a large-scale online survey to examine whether
bulletin users who say they use the avalanche bulletin at a
certain level of sophistication also have the necessary skills
to do so effectively. Finn’s (2020) results offer valuable in-
sight into avalanche bulletin literacy at the different levels of
St. Clair’s (2019) bulletin user typology and highlights user
groups that might have misconceptions about their skill lev-
els.
The third theme of avalanche bulletin research is the ex-
plicit examination of its effectiveness. Empirically testing
how messages resonate with users and whether they result
in the desired behavioural response is an important but chal-
lenging part of risk communication research. An example of
these types of studies in the avalanche ﬁeld include Burkeljca
(2013a, b), who examined the usability of four different
avalanche bulletin products (Canada, Catalonia, Tyrol, and
Utah) using a small sample of 14 that included laypeople
and experts from Slovenia. Winkler and Techel (2014) exam-
ined the results from the same two surveys mentioned previ-
ously to shed light on how the complete revision of the Swiss
avalanche bulletin in 2014 affected users’ perceived quality
and usability of the product. Similarly, Engeset et al. (2018)
conducted an online survey to better understand the effective-
ness of the Norwegian avalanche bulletin. This study explic-
itly asked participants about their preferences for different
forms of information presentation (text, symbols, or pictures)
and empirically assessed users’ comprehension of two haz-
ard situations as a function of the type and amount of infor-
mation presented. The authors used both the appropriateness
of the risk management approaches chosen by participants
and their self-reported effectiveness rating to assess the efﬁ-
cacy of the avalanche hazard descriptions.
Since assessing the suitability of backcountry trips re-
quires recreationists to relate the information provided in
the bulletin to the terrain characteristics of their intended
trips, the description of the spatial distribution of avalanche
hazard within a forecast area is a crucial component of the
avalanche bulletins. While there is considerable complexity
in how avalanche hazard interacts with terrain (see, e.g., Büh-
ler et al., 2013, 2018), the primary location information in-
cluded in avalanche bulletins focuses on elevation and as-
pect. However, current avalanche bulletin products exhibit
substantial variability in what the elevation and aspect in-
formation refers to and how it is presented. Swiss avalanche
bulletins, for example, state a single danger rating for a fore-
cast region, and the accompanying aspect and elevation infor-
mation highlights the core zones where the stated avalanche
danger applies the most (SLF, 2020). The French avalanche
bulletins use the same approach as the Swiss (Météo-France,
2021), whereas the Norwegian bulletins also just publish a
single danger rating per forecast region, but aspect and el-
evation information is used to describe where the identi-
ﬁed avalanche problems are most prevalent (Varsom, 2021).
The recently launched Euregio avalanche bulletin publishes
elevation-speciﬁc avalanche danger ratings and also provides
aspect and elevation information for each of the existing
avalanche problems (TAWS, 2021). Most avalanche bulletins
in North America publish avalanche danger ratings for differ-
ent elevations and describe the location of avalanche prob-
lems with respect to elevation and aspect. While the eleva-
tion descriptions in European avalanche bulletins are gener-
ally speciﬁc (e.g., above 2200 m) and change daily depend-
ing on conditions, North American bulletins use predeﬁned
elevation bands (alpine, treeline or near treeline, and below
treeline) to specify the avalanche danger and the location of
the avalanche problems.
In addition to these differences in the use of elevation
and aspect information, there are also different styles for
how this information is presented. While most of the Euro-
pean and Canadian avalanche warning services use separate
graphics for communicating aspect and elevation informa-
tion, the warning services in the USA and New Zealand use
so-called aspect–elevation rose diagrams that show the ele-
vation and aspect information together in a single graphic
(NZAA, 2021; USFS, 2021; Fig. 1). Within each of these
groups, we can ﬁnd slight variations in design. The aspect–
elevation rose diagrams of the Northwest Avalanche Center
and the Colorado Avalanche Information Center are straight
octagons with grey shading, the aspect–elevation rose of the
New Zealand avalanche warning service has an extra corner
in each aspect segment, and the shading reﬂect the danger
rating of the elevation band, and the Utah Avalanche Cen-
ter used a three-dimensional aspect–elevation rose diagram
(CAIC, 2021; UAC, 2021; NWAC, 2021; NZAA, 2021).
The goal of this study is to contribute to our understand-
ing of the efﬁcacy of avalanche bulletins by empirically test-
ing the effectiveness of individual components. Our starting
point is the fact that a multitude of graphics are used by
avalanche warning services around the world to communi-
cate avalanche problem characteristics. Several studies have
demonstrated that graphics used might not be well under-
stood, and users struggle to combine the information when
making terrain choices (e.g., Burkeljca, 2013a, b; Engeset
et al., 2018; Finn, 2020). To better advise avalanche warn-
ing services on which graphics are most effective with users,

we conducted an online survey to experimentally test if al-
tering the presentation format of the location information of
avalanche problems can improve users’ ability to apply it
to hypothetical terrain choices. The results of this study can
help warning services to improve their avalanche bulletin de-
sign so that recreationists can make better informed choices
about when and where to travel in the backcountry.

## Methods

In the spring of 2020, we conducted a large-scale online sur-
vey to empirically examine different options for improving
the presentation of location information in North American
avalanche bulletins. The three main questions that the survey
aimed to shed light on were as follows:
a. How does the presentation format of the avalanche
problem location information (i.e., aspect and elevation)
affect users’ ability to apply this information when as-
sessing the exposure of routes to avalanche hazard?
b. Can adding an interactive exercise help improve users’
ability to apply the avalanche problem location informa-
tion?
c. How well do the travel advice statements included
in avalanche problem section of North American
avalanche bulletins resonate with users?
The focus of this paper is to present the insight we have
gained about the ﬁrst research question (how does the pre-
sentation format of the avalanche problem location informa-
tion (i.e., aspect and elevation) affect users’ ability to apply
this information when assessing the exposure of routes to
avalanche hazard?). The results that relate to the other two
research questions are described in Fisher (2021) and Fisher
et al. (2021).
2.1
Survey design
To systematically test whether the presentation format of the
avalanche problem location information affects users’ abil-
ity to apply the information, our survey included a series of
route ranking tasks where participants were presented with
an avalanche bulletin with two avalanche problems and a
custom-built topographic map with three routes (Fig. 2). The
terrain map depicted a simpliﬁed mountainscape with slopes
of consistent incline on all aspects and elevation bands. The
task of participants was to study the avalanche bulletin in-
formation and then rank the three depicted routes according

to their exposure to the described avalanche problems. The
correct solution for the ranking task could be determined by
counting the number of aspect and elevation segments each
route crossed where avalanche problems were present. The
more avalanche problem aspect and elevation segments a
route crossed, the more exposed it was to avalanche hazard.
Whereas examining only the exposure of the shown routes
does not fully represent the risk assessment process required
for making informed trip planning decisions, our task design
allowed us to eliminate any inﬂuences of participants’ per-
sonal perception of the danger scale and their risk propen-
sities in our experiment. In addition, it prevented us from
having to quantify which avalanche problems were more or
less hazardous under the same danger rating. All these as-
pects would have made it impossible to deﬁne objectively
correct solutions for the route ranking task and resulted in a
much more challenging analysis. Participants were explicitly
alerted that overhead hazard and terrain traps should not be
included in their assessment.
In our experiment, the avalanche problem information was
presented in one of three graphic formats (Fig. 3). The ﬁrst
format had aspect and elevation information separated for
each avalanche problem, similar to the graphic used in Cana-
dian avalanche bulletins, while the second format had aspect
and elevation combined into a single aspect–elevation rose
graphic for each avalanche problem, like in the US bulletins,
and the third format presented the aspect and elevation in-
formation for all avalanche problems combined. Throughout
the rest of this paper, we will refer to these three presentation
formats as separate, aspect–elevation rose, and combined. To
prevent the speciﬁcs of the avalanche bulletin information
from affecting our results in unintended ways, our experi-
ment included six different avalanche bulletin scenarios (see
the Appendix), all of which were developed in conjunction
with avalanche industry experts to ensure that they represent
realistic, real-world conditions.
Each survey participant was presented with two random
avalanche bulletin scenarios, using one of the three aspect
and elevation information presentations, and they completed
two route ranking exercises for each of the bulletin scenar-
ios. The ﬁrst ranking exercise for each bulletin scenario in-
cluded simple routes that crossed only one aspect, whereas
the second exercise had complex routes that crossed multi-
ple aspects (Fig. 2). Between the two avalanche bulletin sce-
narios, participants were presented with a range of different
learning interventions to examine how an interactive exer-
cise can affect participants’ ability to apply the avalanche
problem information to terrain. These learning interventions
included a self-reﬂection exercise, showing participants the
correct route ranking, and providing users with the correct
route ranking and explaining it. However, this part of the
experiment is not the focus of this paper. Interested readers
are referred to Fisher et al. (2021) for a complete description
of this part of our study. In summary, the experimental por-
tion of the survey included four route ranking tasks that were
completed in the following sequence:
1. Avalanche bulletin scenario 1 – simple routes
2. Avalanche bulletin scenario 1 – complex routes
3. Learning interventions (none, self-reﬂection, solution,
and solution with explanation)
4. Avalanche bulletin scenario 2 – simple routes
5. Avalanche bulletin scenario 2 – complex routes.
After completion of the route ranking tasks, participants
were shown all three avalanche problem information graph-
ics and asked to rate their effectiveness for communicating
the location information of avalanche problems on a scale
from 0 (not effective at all) to 100 (extremely effective). In
addition, participants were given the opportunity to provide
additional comments in a text box.
Our survey included a wide range of background ques-
tions to contextualize the results of the route ranking exer-
cise and the effectiveness ratings. We drew from questions
included in Finn’s (2020) survey and asked participants to
indicate their primary modes of recreating in the backcoun-
try, which avalanche bulletin region they recreate in, how of-
ten they check the bulletin, how many years and days per
year of experience they had, what their overall attitude to-
wards avalanches is, the level of avalanche training they
had completed, and their bulletin user type, as described by
St. Clair (2019). Additional questions asked participants to
identify how much weight they ascribe to different bulletin
sections and rate their conﬁdence in their abilities to un-
derstand the bulletin, recognize hazardous conditions in the
ﬁeld, make safe choices, and read topographic maps. Also in-
cluded in the survey was a question explicitly testing users’
topographic map reading skills, as well as basic sociodemo-
graphic questions, including self-identiﬁed gender, age, ed-
ucation level, location of residence, and colourlessness. In-
terested readers are referred to Fisher (2021) for a complete
description of our survey, including screenshots.
The survey was developed during the early part of the
2019–2020 winter season and extensively tested in Febru-
ary and March 2020 prior to release. Survey testing began
with an initial round of testers with moderate to high levels
of winter backcountry recreation experience and avalanche
industry experts. A second round of testing included users
from novice to expert participants. The survey was also re-
viewed and approved by the Ofﬁce for Research Ethics of
Simon Fraser University (SFU ethics approval 2020s0074).
2.2
Recruitment and survey development
The primary target audience for our survey was North Amer-
ican avalanche bulletin users, who we recruited in a variety of
ways. The foundation of our recruitment were 3047 bulletin

users who participated in previous avalanche bulletin sur-
veys conducted by our research program and indicated that
they were interested in participating in future studies. The
survey was ofﬁcially launched on 23 March 2020 by send-
ing invitation emails to 300 individuals from this existing
panel of prospective participants. This soft launch allowed
us to monitor the initial responses and address any survey is-
sues if necessary. However, the survey worked as designed,
and no modiﬁcations were required. On 26 March 2020, we
sent invitation emails to the rest of our panel of prospective
participants (2747 individuals), and between 26 March and
1 April 2020, the survey was also actively promoted by our
partnering avalanche warning services (Avalanche Canada,
Parks Canada, Colorado Avalanche Information Centre, and
Northwest Avalanche Center). Each of these warning ser-
vices helped us recruit participants by including a banner on
their bulletin website and promoting the survey through their
social media channels. We also advertised our study by post-
ing on various social media sites popular among winter back-
country users, such as South Coast Touring and Backcountry
YYC on Facebook, and by reaching out to community lead-
ers to distribute the survey among their followers.
To ensure meaningful and even samples for each of the
experimental treatments included in our survey (type of loca-

tion information graphic and type of feedback), participants
were stratiﬁed according to their preferred winter backcoun-
try activity and bulletin user type before being assigned to
one of the experimental treatments. This guaranteed that all
treatment combinations had representation from each winter
backcountry activity and bulletin user type, even if they were
relatively small.
The survey sample for the present analysis was drawn on
31 May 2020, after which no additional surveys were in-
cluded in analysis. At the close of the survey, 6789 individ-
uals had started our survey and 3668 (55.3 %) completed it.
The vast majority of the dropouts (1829; 58.6 % of dropouts)
did not continue after looking at the ﬁrst page of the sur-
vey that described the objective of the study and structure
of the survey. The dropout rate for individual survey pages
was 1 % or less, except for the page that introduced the route
ranking task (57, 3.4 %). Of the individuals who completed
the survey, 1600 (44.6 %) were participants of previous sur-
vey studies of our research group who received an invita-
tion email. Other substantial recruitment sources included
announcements on avalanche bulletin websites (17.5 % of
participants who completed survey), social media posts by
collaborating avalanche warning services (9.2 %), and other
posts in social media groups (e.g., Facebook and Instagram)
focused on winter backcountry recreation (21.5 %).
2.3
Data analysis
We focused on the following triad of performance mea-
sures to assess the effectiveness of the three different aspect–
elevation graphics in a meaningful way:
– the correctness of participants’ answers in the route
ranking exercise,
– participants’ completion time of the route ranking exer-
cise, and
– participants’ perceived effectiveness of the three graph-
ics.
Our an initial hypothesis was that a more effective presenta-
tion would be associated with a higher percentage of correct
answers, quicker completion times, and higher perceived ef-
fectiveness ratings.
This combination of measures provides a comprehensive
perspective on the effectiveness of the different graphics that
builds on existing research into the role of cognitive load in
the success of different graphic types. Response time and re-
sponse accuracy of primary and secondary tasks was used by
Dindar et al. (2015) to measure the cognitive load of static
and animated graphics on students learning English. The au-
thors additionally used self-reported cognitive load as an ad-
ditional metric to estimate cognitive load. In this study, we
replaced the subjective, explicit request to estimate cogni-
tive load with a question asking about perceived effective-
ness. We also focused our study on a single type of task be-
cause of our interest in directly measuring how the graphic
inﬂuences the application of bulletin information. Our single-
task approach is similar to Martin-Michiellot and Mendel-
sohn (2000), who measured response time and assessment
accuracy in relation to different computer manual presenta-
tion formats.
Our analysis approach started with the use of standard de-
scriptive statistics to describe the nature of the analysis data
set and explore the relationships between different variables.
The core of our analysis consisted of three generalized lin-
ear mixed effects models (GLMMs) that explored the three
different performance measures outlined above. GLMMs are
an extension of generalized linear models that properly ac-
count for the correlations that emerge from repeated measure
designs or nested data structures (Harrison et al., 2018; Zuur
et al., 2009). To accommodate these data structure, GLMMs
include both ﬁxed and random effects in the regression equa-
tions. The ﬁxed effects, which are equivalent to the inter-
cept and slope estimates in traditional regression models,
capture the relationship between the predictor and response
variables for the entire data set. While traditional regression
models assign the remaining unexplained variance in the data
(i.e., randomness) entirely to the overall error term, mixed-
effect models partition the unexplained variance that origi-
nates from groupings within the data set into random effects.
Thus, random effects highlight how groups within the data

3226
K. C. Fisher et al.: Impact of information presentation on interpretability of spatial hazard information
set deviate from the overall pattern described by the ﬁxed
effects included in the model. While there is some judge-
ment involved in deciding what predictors are included in a
GLMM as a ﬁxed or random effect, it is generally the group-
ing variables that are not explicitly of interest that enter the
analysis as random effects.
To assess how the graphics inﬂuence the participants’ abil-
ity to complete the route ranking task correctly, their re-
sponses were graded as follows. Participants who ordered all
three routes correctly received a passing grade, whereas all
other responses were assigned a failing grade. This means
that we ended up with a binary response variable, which we
examined with a logistic mixed effects regression model that
uses a logit link to model the relationship between a binary
response variable and one or more predictors. The random
effects included in this model were participant ID and the
ranking task avalanche scenario.
To examine the effect of the graphics on completion
time in seconds, we used a gamma mixed effects regression
model, which is suitable for a continuous, positive, poten-
tially right-skewed response variable. Similar to the model
for correctness, we included the participant ID and ranking
task scenario as random effects.
The third and last GLMM included in this analysis ex-
plored the relationship between the graphics and partici-
pants’ ratings of perceived effectiveness. Since these ratings
were on a bound scale from 0 to 100, we used a beta mixed
effect regression model for this analysis (Cribari-Neto and
Zeileis, 2010). Similar to the logistic regression model, a beta
regression uses a logit link to relate the response variable to
the predictors in a constrained way. Prior to analysis, we di-
vided participants’ ratings by 100 to scale them down to 0 to
1 and transformed them with ytrans = (yorig(n −1) + 0.5)/n
(n represents the number of observations), as suggested by
Smithson and Verkuilen (2006), to eliminate values that are
exactly 0 or 1 since they cannot be handled by the beta re-
gression. In this model, participant ID was the only random
effect, as each participant rated all three graphics but there
were no scenarios.
Since assessing the impact of the graphic and how this ef-
fect might vary among different levels of avalanche training
is the main objective of this study, the initial versions of all
three models included the type of aspect–elevation graphic
and participants’ level of formal avalanche training as predic-
tor variables (both as main and interaction effects). The cor-
rectness and completion time models also included the fol-
lowing variable describing the nature of the ranking task: the
complexity of the route options (simple or complex), whether
it was the ﬁrst or second set of route ranking tasks, and what
type of feedback was provided between the two sets. In addi-
tion to these default predictors, the effects of other partic-
ipant characteristics (e.g., primary winter backcountry ac-
tivity, whether the survey was completed on a smartphone,
and the score on the map reading test) and route ranking
task attributes (e.g., overall number of correctly completed
ranking tasks and which graphic was used in ranking tasks)
were explored during the model building process. The pre-
dictors were only kept in the models if they contributed to
the model as determined by a type II Wald chi-squared test
with a p value smaller than 0.050 and the size of their effects
were meaningful. Differences between model variants were
assessed with likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian Informa-
tion Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) and model interpretabil-
ity were used to guide ﬁnal model selection.
We conducted our entire analysis in R (version 4.0.5; R
Core Team, 2021) and used the glmmTMB package (Brooks
et al., 2017) to estimate our mixed effects models. The type
II Wald chi-squared tests were calculated using the ANOVA
function of the car package (Fox and Weisberg, 2019). To
assess violations in model assumptions, we simulated quan-
tile residuals (Dunn and Smyth, 1996), as implemented in
the DHARMa package (Hartig, 2020). Visual inspection of
the resulting diagnostic plots (e.g., Q–Q plot for uniformly
distributed residuals) did not suggest any substantial model
violations. Due to the logit link function and the presence of
both the main and interaction effects, the parameter estimates
emerging from the regression models in this study are difﬁ-
cult to interpret directly. To make the results more tangible,
we calculated marginal means of the response variables (i.e.,
correctness, completion time, and perceived effectiveness)
for the levels of different predictor variables and followed up
with post hoc pairwise comparisons to assess whether these
estimates were signiﬁcantly different from each other. We
performed this part of the analysis using the functions in-
cluded in the emmeans package (Lenth, 2019). To counteract
the issue of type I error inﬂation from multiple comparisons,
we calculated Holm-corrected p values. The results of these
analyses are presented in so-called effects plots, which dis-
play the differences between levels of a predictor variable of
interest while holding all other predictor variables constant
at their base levels. Hence, it is more important to look at the
differences between the attribute levels of the predictor vari-
able of interest than the absolute values since these charts
simply illustrate the magnitude of the effect of the predictor
variable and do not provide an overview of the overall nature
of the data set.

## Results

3.1
Participant demographics
To ensure meaningful results, we only included participants
in our analysis data set who completed all pages of the sur-
vey, whose reported residence was in Canada or the USA,
who were over the age of 20, and whose choices for pri-
mary activity and avalanche awareness training aligned with
the predeﬁned options. In addition, we excluded participants
who took less than 10 min or more than 2 h to complete the
survey, or who spent longer than 10 min completing the route

ranking tasks or reading feedback between the tasks. These
cutoffs were chosen after a visual inspection of the distribu-
tion of page viewing times and are expected to represent par-
ticipants who either did not engage with the survey or were
interrupted. The ﬁnal analysis data set consisted of 3056 par-
ticipants, which represented 83.3 % of the 3668 individuals
who completed the survey. The median completion time of
the survey was 24.6 min, with an interquartile range of 18.5
to 32.6 min.
Of the 3056 participants, 76.9 % self-identiﬁed as male
(2328 participants), 36.9 % (1125 participants) were between
25 and 34 years old, and 79.8 % had university-level (or
higher) education (2426 participants; Fig. 4a and b). In terms
of avalanche safety training, 46.9 % (1433 participants) had
taken an introductory level recreational avalanche safety
course, 18.9 % (577 participants) an advanced level recre-
ational course, and 16.4 % (501 participants) had completed
a professional training course (Fig. 4d). Backcountry skiers
represented the highest proportion of recreationists in the
study, with 80.1 % of the sample (2448 participants) identify-
ing backcountry skiing as their primary backcountry winter
activity (Fig. 4c). Additional types of recreationists present in
our sample included out-of-bounds skiers (7.4 %; 227 partic-
ipants), snowshoers (5.5 %, ;68 participants), snowmobilers
(5.1 %; 156 participants), and less than 2 % ice climbers. The
largest group of participants (31.3 %; 955 participants) were
relatively new to their sport, with 2 to 5 years of backcoun-
try experience (Fig. 4e). However, the second-largest group
of participants (24.5 %; 750 participants) had over 20 years
of experience. Bulletin user types “D – Distinguish Problem
Conditions” and “E – Extends Analysis” made up 75.6 %
of participants (2312; Fig. 4f). Finally, 69.8 % (2134) of re-
sponses were from residents of the USA.
3.2
Correctness of participants’ answers
Overall, our analysis data set included 12 224 individual
route ranking tasks, of which 74.6 % were completed cor-
rectly. Our ﬁnal model for the probability of completing
the route ranking task correctly included seven ﬁxed effects.
The main effect for type of feedback and the interaction ef-
fects between graphic type and participants’ level of formal
avalanche training and the interaction effects between type of
feedback and participants’ level of formal avalanche training
were eliminated due to p values being larger than 0.05 (type
II Wald chi-square test). The parameter estimates from the
regression analysis are presented in Table 1, but the effects
plots (Fig. 5) show the key results in a more tangible way.
The avalanche problem information graphic that a partic-
ipant saw during the task exercises had a signiﬁcant main
effect on whether a participant completed the tasks correctly
(Fig. 5a). Comparing the three information formats shows
that participants who saw the aspect–elevation rose graphic
were the most likely to complete the tasks correctly (proba-
bility = 0.752).1 Participants who saw the combined graphic
had signiﬁcantly lower probability (0.711; p value < 0.008)2
of completing the tasks correctly than those who saw the
aspect–elevation rose. Similarly, participants seeing the sep-
arate graphic were less likely to complete the tasks correctly
than those seeing the aspect–elevation rose (0.722), but the
difference was statistically not signiﬁcant (p value = 0.085).
Furthermore, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
in the performance between participants who were presented
with the separate and combined graphic (p value = 0.775).
The level of avalanche training a participant had com-
pleted was also a signiﬁcant predictor of completing the
task correctly (Fig. 5b). Participants with professional train-
ing had the highest probability of completing the task cor-
rectly (0.768) followed by participants with advanced and
introductory-level recreational training (0.739 and 0.737).
The probability of participants with no training completing
the tasks correctly was 0.664. Our examination of the dif-
ferences between consecutive levels revealed that the differ-
ence between participants with no training and introductory-
level recreational training was signiﬁcant (odds ratio of 1.42;
p value < 0.001). The increase between recreational and
professional level training was not statistically signiﬁcant
(p value = 0.259).
Additional factors that changed the probability of complet-
ing the tasks correctly included route type and task set. Par-
ticipants were more likely to complete tasks correctly with
the simple routes than the complex ones (0.800 vs. 0.643;
p value < 0.001) and during the second set of tasks rather
than the ﬁrst set (0.745 and 0.712; p value < 0.001). Partici-
pants’ probability of completing the tasks correctly was also
related to characteristics such as their primary backcountry
activity, success on the map reading task, and phone use.
Within our sample, individuals who identiﬁed snowmobiling
as their primary activity were signiﬁcantly less likely to com-
plete the tasks correctly than backcountry skiers (0.656 vs.
0.784; p value < 0.001). Snowmobile-accessed backcountry
skiers exhibited a similar pattern to snowmobilers, with a
probability of 0.636 of completing the tasks correctly. Par-
ticipants who passed the map test were more likely to com-
plete the tasks correctly than those who failed it (0.771 vs.
0.682; p value < 0.001). Participants who completed the sur-
vey on a phone were less likely to complete the tasks success-
fully than those who used a desktop device (0.711 vs. 0.745;
p value = 0.005).

est, while holding all other predictor variables constant at their base
levels.

3.3
Participants’ completion time
Participants took a median of 87.0 s to complete the route
ranking task exercises, and the interquartile range of com-
pletion times was from 60.0–134.0 s. Our ﬁnal model de-
scribing completion time of the task exercises included seven
main effects, and individual participants and bulletin scenar-
ios were included as random effects (Table 2). As in the cor-
rectness model, the interactions effects between graphic type
and participants’ level of formal avalanche training, as well
as between type of feedback and participants’ level of formal
avalanche training, were eliminated due to p values being
larger than 0.05 (type II Wald chi-squared test).
Our analysis revealed that the format of the avalanche
problem information graphic had a signiﬁcant effect on the
completion time for route ranking task (Fig. 5c). Based on
the estimated model, participants who saw the information
with aspect and elevation separate for each avalanche prob-
lem (separate) took the longest time to complete the tasks
(estimated marginal mean 107.4 s). Participants who saw the
aspect–elevation rose or combined graphic took signiﬁcantly
less time to complete the tasks. The estimated marginal
means for the completion time were 94.9 s (difference of
−12.5 s; p value < 0.001) for the aspect–elevation rose and
93.5 s (difference of −13.9 s; p value < 0.001) for the com-
bined graphics. The difference between the aspect–elevation
rose and combined graphics did not emerge as signiﬁcant
(1.4 s; p value = 0.0.725).
Our analysis also revealed a signiﬁcant effect of the type
of feedback participants received between the two sets of
route ranking exercises. Relative to receiving no feedback,
participants who had to articulate their process took signif-
icantly longer to complete the task (difference of +6.4 s;
p value = 0.006), whereas receiving the solutions with or
without explanations did not result in a signiﬁcant difference
in completion times (p values = 0.817 and 0.752).
Avalanche training had a signiﬁcant effect on comple-
tion time (Fig. 5d). In general, the more recreational-level
training participants had completed, the longer they took to
complete the task. Based on the model, participants with
advanced-level recreational training took the longest to com-
plete the route ranking task (103.0 s; 13.0 s longer than par-

ticipants with no formal training; p value < 0.001), closely
followed by participants with professional training, who
completed the tasks in 102.1 s (12.1 s longer than partici-
pants with no formal training; p value < 0.001). Participants
with introductory-level recreational training took 98.9 s (dif-
ference 8.9 s; p value < 0.001), and participants without any
training 90.0 s. This means that the biggest jump between
consecutive categories occurs between no and introductory-
level recreational training, and the effect diminishes with
higher levels of training.
Other factors that emerged as being signiﬁcant predic-
tors of completion time include the experimental variables
route type and the task set, as well as the participants’
characteristics map reading test result and age. Participants
ranking a scenario with complex routes took 11.6 s longer
(p value < 0.001) than when ranking simple routes. Con-
versely, participants were quicker at ranking the second set
of routes than the ﬁrst set (89.7 vs. 108.0 s; p value < 0.001).
Participants who failed the map reading test also completed
the tasks substantially more quickly than participants who
passed (93.5 vs. 103.6 s; p value < 0.001). Completion times
increased linearly with the age category of participants, with
each increasing age class taking approximately 3 s longer
(p value < 0.001).

Perceived effectiveness rating

ness ratings included six main effects and three two-way

interaction effects (Table 3). Across all participants, the
highest ratings were given to the aspect–elevation rose
graphic, with an estimated marginal mean rating of 78.4
out of 100. This is signiﬁcantly higher than either the sep-
arate (71.7; p value < 0.001) or combined graphics (71.9;
p value < 0.001). There was no signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the ratings for these two graphics (p value = 0.973).
In addition to the overall effect of the information pre-
sentation format, there was also an interaction effect with
a participant’s country of residence (Fig. 6a). Canadian res-
idents gave nearly identical ratings for the separate graph-
ics (75.0) and the aspect–elevation rose diagram (74.8), with
no signiﬁcant difference between them (p value = 0.990).
Canadian residents rated the combined graphic the lowest of
the three formats (71.7), which was signiﬁcantly lower than
the other presentation formats (p value = 0.012 and 0.017,
respectively). In contrast, USA residents rated the aspect–
elevation rose diagram signiﬁcantly higher (81.6) than ei-
ther the separate (68.3; p value < 0.001) or combined (72.1;
p value < 0.001) graphics. Unlike Canadian residents, USA
residents rated the separate graphic signiﬁcantly lower than
the combined presentation format (p value = 0.001).
In addition to the interaction effect above, there was also
an interaction effect between the format of the avalanche
problem graphics and a participant’s completed level of
avalanche awareness training (Fig. 6b). The ratings of the
aspect–elevation rose tended to increase with increasing lev-
els of training. For participants who had completed pro-
fessional level training, the aspect–elevation rose was rated
79.2 vs. the separate graphic at 71.1 (signiﬁcantly differ-
ent; p value < 0.001) and for the combined graphic it was
68.3 (signiﬁcantly different from aspect–elevation rose at

p value < 0.001 and not signiﬁcantly different than the sepa-
rate style at p value = 0.18). The difference in rating between
the aspect–elevation rose and other styles decreased at lower
levels of training, showing that, at lower levels of training, the
effect of the aspect–elevation rose graphic is not as preferred
over other formats. Among participants with no training, the
difference between the aspect–elevation rose and the separate
graphic was the smallest (77.4 vs. 73.1; p value = 0.005), and
no other differences were signiﬁcant among this group.
Another interaction effect was observed between the infor-
mation presentation and whether a participant used it during
the task exercises. Participants rated graphics they used dur-
ing the task section of the survey higher than graphics they
did not use during the survey (Fig. 6c). However, the differ-
ence in the rating for the graphics between participants who
had not and who had used them was lower for the aspect–
elevation rose than for the separate or combined graphics.
This shows that the aspect–elevation rose graphic was rated
higher than the other two graphics, even when participants
had no familiarity with the icon from previous use in the sur-
vey.
There was also an interaction effect between the format
of the graphics and how well a participant performed during
the task exercises. For the aspect–elevation rose and com-
bined graphic, participants’ ratings of the graphics tended to
increase with the number of tasks they completed correctly.
In contrast, ratings of the separate graphic tended to decrease
with the number of tasks a participant completed correctly.
Unlike the other models, only one additional explana-
tory factor contributed to explaining the variation in rat-
ings. Participants who used their phone overall rated all of
the graphics just slightly more favourably (75.3 vs. 73.0;
p value < 0.001).

## Discussion

We deﬁned the success of an avalanche problem location in-
formation graphic based on whether participants completed
the ranking task exercises correctly, how long it took them to
complete the task, and how highly they rated the perceived
effectiveness of the graphics. The use of regression analysis
allowed us to isolate the inﬂuence of the graphics on each of
these three metrics by controlling for the other inﬂuencing
factors.
We can present an overall picture of the user experience
with each graphic by looking at a combination of the three
metrics described above. The separate graphic led to lower
rates of correct task completion, slower task completion
times, and was given relatively low ratings by all levels of
training. Canadian residents rated the separate graphic as be-
ing about equivalently useful as the aspect–elevation rose di-
agram, but USA residents rated it the lowest of all the graph-
ics. The separate graphic received low ratings when com-
pared to the aspect–elevation rose, regardless of whether it
was used in the task exercises or not. These results indicate
that the separate graphic has challenges in communicating
avalanche problem information, and we suspect that its pop-
ularity among Canadian residents is likely due to familiarity.
The aspect–elevation rose graphic led to the highest rate
of correct task completion, fast completion times, and was
given the highest rating by all levels of training. It received
the highest ratings, regardless of whether or not survey par-
ticipants used it during the task exercises, and was rated the
highest graphic by USA residents by far and was considered
as being equivalent to the separate graphic by Canadian res-
idents. These results indicate that the aspect–elevation rose
diagram is an effective graphic for communicating avalanche
problem information and is likely to be accepted by many
users.
The combined graphic led to lower rates of correct task
completion, on par with the separate graphic, but fast com-
pletion times. The combined graphic received relatively low
ratings by both Canadian and USA residents, regardless of
whether or not it was used in the task. It received low ratings
across all training levels, with ratings decreasing as training
increased. These results indicated that the combined graphic
is not effective for communicating avalanche problem infor-
mation and is not likely to be accepted by users.
4.1
Cognitive load perspective on results
Our results are consistent with existing research on the ef-
fect of cognitive load on task performance. According to
cognitive load theory, individuals have limited memory re-
sources to apply to processing information, and that cog-
nitive load increases with an increase in working memory
use. Higher levels of cognitive load often lead to poor learn-
ing outcomes, lower task success, or trouble applying in-
formation (Allen et al., 2014; Dindar et al., 2015; Martin-
Michiellot and Mendelsohn, 2000). Sweller et al. (2011) de-
scribe how cognitive load is altered by “interactivity”, which
refers to the elements that must be processed simultaneously
to be understood. Higher levels of interactivity generally lead
to higher cognitive load. The authors further highlight that
more information can be processed simultaneously when the
information is broken down into meaningful chunks known
as schema. Cognitive load can also be described as being ei-
ther intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic cognitive load refers to
the challenge inherent in understanding information or com-
pleting a task, whereas extrinsic cognitive load emerges from
how the material is presented (Sweller et al., 2011). These
two types of cognitive load are additive, with both competing
for working memory capacity. If a task has a high intrinsic
cognitive load, it is advised to reduce the extrinsic cognitive
load as much as possible, as studies have found that people
struggle with making behavioural choices when information
is presented in a cognitively demanding format (Allen et al.,
2014). There are multiple strategies for estimating cognitive
https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3219-2021

3234
K. C. Fisher et al.: Impact of information presentation on interpretability of spatial hazard information
load that include performance on tasks, efﬁciency of task
completion, and self-reported ratings of cognitive load – of-
ten in combination – although the relationship between mea-
surements varies under different conditions (Dindar et al.,
2015; Sweller et al., 2011). In the avalanche safety context
of this study, interpreting the avalanche problem graphics and
making the route choice selection both demand cognitive re-
sources from participants. Based on this, we can think of the
metrics used to evaluate the problem graphics in this study as
being reﬂective of the cognitive load experienced during the
task exercises. Completion of the route ranking exercise is
in itself an intrinsically challenging activity but did not vary
between treatments, so it is expected that differences in out-
come reﬂect the extrinsic cognitive load of the graphics.
The concept of extrinsic cognitive load helps explain the
poor success of the separate and combined presentation for-
mats. The separate graphic is distinguished by a low success
rate on the route ranking exercise, slow completion time, and
low ratings for the graphic’s perceived effectiveness. All of
these indicators together suggest that the route ranking exer-
cise with this presentation format for the avalanche problem
location information produced a high cognitive load that led
to poor performance. In this presentation format, users had
to combine the aspect and elevation information for multi-
ple avalanche problems. Each individual component of the
graphic could only be applied to the terrain once combined
with the others, which means that this presentation format
exhibits high element interactivity. We hypothesize that this
high element interactivity led participants to focus their cog-
nitive resources on interpreting the graphic and lowering the
resources available for actually applying the information to
the terrain and ranking the routes. Additionally, to integrate
the information, users had to direct their attention to multi-
ple locations in the graphic to make sense of the informa-
tion. There is evidence that this kind of attention splitting
also leads to a higher cognitive load on individuals (Martin-
Michiellot and Mendelsohn, 2000; Sweller et al., 2011).
With evidence that integrated information should lead to
reduced cognitive load, one would expected that the com-
bined graphic would lead to the least cognitive load because
it integrates the most information into a single graphic. How-
ever, our results show that users also had a high amount
of difﬁculty in applying the information from this presenta-
tion format to the route ranking exercise, as demonstrated by
the low correctness scores despite faster completion times.
This result may be due to the high visual complexity of the
combined graphic, leading to a high extrinsic cognitive load
for the graphic. The combined graphic uses multiple colours
to represent avalanche problems, and the meaning of the
colours must be distinguished and interpreted to understand
the information presented in the graphic. Complex visuals
have been shown to be difﬁcult to interpret as they increase
users’ extrinsic cognitive load (Anderson et al., 2011; Harold
et al., 2020; Masri et al., 2008). Therefore, we suggest that
the extrinsic load from the complex visuals was high enough
to reduce performance on the route ranking exercise. Our re-
sults also mirror the result of studies on website complex-
ity and hospital signage, showing that visuals with medium
levels of complexity perform most successfully with users
(Rousek et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014).
From a cognitive load perspective, the ﬁnding that the
aspect–elevation rose diagram performs best is not surpris-
ing. This presentation format mitigates the cognitive load
required to integrate the avalanche problem aspect and ele-
vation information by combining those elements into a sin-
gle graphic, thereby lowering element interactivity. However,
it keeps the avalanche problems separate. This degree of
integrating information may correspond well to users’ ex-
isting schema or mental model about avalanche danger. In
North America, the conceptual model of avalanche hazard
uses avalanche problems as a framework to organize infor-
mation about avalanche hazard. In the conceptual model, a
location is identiﬁed as one of four main characteristics of
avalanche problems and, at the bulletin scale, the location
is described by aspect and elevation (Statham et al., 2018a).
The success of the aspect–elevation rose graphic may be in
part because it taps into this existing conceptual framework
for thinking about location as a single characteristic deﬁning
avalanche problems. The aspect–elevation rose graphic is the
only graphic that represents the location for each avalanche
problem and, therefore, most closely represents aspect and
elevation as they are included in the conceptual model. In
contrast, the combined graphic – with it is combination of
avalanche problems into a single graphic – aggregates loca-
tion information at a higher level than is used in the concep-
tual model of avalanche hazard.
4.2
Implications for avalanche warning services
The results of this study offer valuable insights for avalanche
warning services seeking to communicate avalanche problem
information to users more effectively. Our ﬁndings indicate
that the aspect–elevation rose diagram leads to the best per-
formance in the route ranking task, indicating that this pre-
sentation format may be best suited towards helping recre-
ationists use the information as part of the avalanche bul-
letin. The aspect–elevation rose was the most effective across
all groups, and even users accustomed to the Canadian-style
graphic can beneﬁt from the USA-style graphic. It is impor-
tant to remember, however, that the location information pre-
sented in our survey used predeﬁne elevation bands, and it is
unclear whether the aspect–elevation rose graphic is also the
preferred presentation format with variable elevation values
commonly used by European avalanche warning services.
Still, the cognitive load perspective indicates that having sep-
arate graphics with variable elevation values would likely re-
sult in a higher extrinsic load than separate graphics with
static elevation values, and we, therefore, expect that presen-
tation format to be even more challenging and error prone.

3235
Our results show that avalanche warning services inter-
ested in changing their information presentation might ini-
tially ﬁnd resistance from their users, as users prefer graph-
ics that they are already familiar with. The interaction be-
tween the country of residence and preference rating for the
graphics suggests that users hold favourable perceptions of
whichever graphic they are most familiar with. However,
users may be ﬂexible and willing to accept new graphics after
experience with the graphics. Comparing the preferences of
users on a per-graphic basis, participants who saw the com-
bined graphic during the task exercises exhibited the great-
est increase in rating compared to those who did not use it.
This boost to the preference of the combined graphics by par-
ticipants who used it in the tasks suggests that it may take
relatively little time for users to become accustomed to a
change in avalanche problem information graphics. This sug-
gests any resistance to changing graphics used in the bulletin
may be short lived.
Other results from this study that may be of interest to
avalanche warning services is the ﬁnding that avalanche ed-
ucation was a strong predictor of how successfully peo-
ple completed the ranking task. We found that participants
with recreational-level avalanche awareness training per-
formed similarly to those with professional-level training, re-
gardless of which graphics they used, which indicates that
recreational training is successfully helping users interpret
avalanche bulletins. This is consistent with prior research
demonstrating that avalanche education is a signiﬁcant fac-
tor inﬂuencing avalanche bulletin literacy (Finn, 2020). More
importantly in the context of the objective of this study, how-
ever, our results show that the aspect–elevation rose is the
best presentation format for all training levels. Hence, there
is no need to design different sets of graphics for beginners.
Additionally, this study found that participants with dif-
ferent primary backcountry activities performed differently
on the task exercises even after controlling for avalanche
awareness training. However, there was no interaction ef-
fect between the type of avalanche problem graphic used and
participants’ primary backcountry activity, indicating that
the graphic use was not a factor in this variation in perfor-
mance. Avalanche warning services can use this as evidence
that changing avalanche problem graphics will not disadvan-
tage backcountry recreationists of any sport. However, even
though the survey was open to all winter backcountry recre-
ationists, most participants were backcountry skiers, and the
routes shown in the ranking tasks were optimized to be real-
istic for backcountry skiing. This means that the route rank-
ing exercise may have not fully resonated with other activity
groups, such as snowmobilers, snowshoers, or ice climbers.
Hence, the results presented in this study should only be ex-
trapolated to these user groups with caution. To better under-
stand the skills and perspectives of all types of avalanche bul-
letin users, future studies should seek to create hypothetical
terrain scenarios tailored to a wider range of backcountry ac-
tivities. Additional research is needed to determine if the ef-
fects observed during this desktop exercise can be translated
into increased recognition of hazardous aspect and elevation
combinations in the ﬁeld.
Despite the improved performance of participants with the
aspect–elevation rose and the positive impact of avalanche
awareness education, the fact that, overall, only 74.6 % of the
route ranking tasks were completed correctly highlights that
additional interventions might be necessary to help avalanche
bulletin users make better use of the presented location infor-
mation. Klassen (2012) highlighted that the next frontier of
avalanche bulletins is to better assist users linking the hazard
information to terrain, and the http://www.skitourenguru.ch
(last access: 1 April 2021) web platform (Schmudlach and
Köhler, 2016) is an example of a decision aid that auto-
matically evaluates the current severity of backcountry ski
routes based on the location-speciﬁc avalanche hazard infor-
mation presented in bulletins. While these types of decision
aids have great potential for helping backcountry recreation-
ists avoid application mistakes and make better use of the
bulletin information, a detailed examination of how users in-
terpret the severity ratings of the ski routes is critical for a
better understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the
automated avalanche hazard information processing.
The success of combining avalanche problem aspect and
elevation into the aspect–elevation rose graphic opens new
doors for further improvements to the avalanche bulletin.
In addition to aspect and elevation, likelihood and size are
two additional avalanche problem characteristics that are pre-
sented graphically in North American avalanche bulletins.
While likelihood and size are assessed and presented in a
single chart in the conceptual model of avalanche hazard
(Statham et al., 2018a), the two characteristics are presented
in separate graphics in North American bulletins. Since this
study has demonstrated that there are beneﬁts to linking con-
ceptually related avalanche hazard information into a single
graphic for public use in avalanche bulletins, future research
should seek to identify if this principle could also be ex-
tended to present likelihood and size in a single graphic or
if it would disadvantage users with low graphical literacy.

## Limitations

The participant sample in this study demonstrates trends
consistent with previous surveys of backcountry recreation
users. A high proportion of university-educated, male, back-
country skiers between 25 and 34 years of age, with ba-
sic avalanche education, engage in online surveys about
avalanche safety (Finn, 2020; Haegeli and Strong-Cvetich,
2020; Haegeli et al., 2012). The similarity in sample demo-
graphics may be drawn from the similar survey promotion
techniques used between this study and Finn (2020). Al-
though this study and Finn (2020) did reach a wider range of
users than previous studies, it only captures the behaviour of
the demographic that responds to an online survey and may

K. C. Fisher et al.: Impact of information presentation on interpretability of spatial hazard information
underrepresent non-English-speaking participants or other
demographics.
Since this study focused primarily on a North American
audience, and our survey design did not include presenta-
tion formats with variable elevation values commonly used
in European avalanche bulletins, the recommendations of our
study should be applied with caution. Future research in this
area should test a wider range of presentation formats, in-
cluding the European location graphics, the direct presenta-
tion of hazard locations on maps, and automated route sever-
ity ratings.

## Conclusions

To make informed decisions about when and where to travel
in the backcountry, winter backcountry recreationists need to
manage their risk from avalanches by monitoring the hazard
conditions and relating this information to the terrain char-
acteristics of their intended trips. The daily avalanche bul-
letins published by local avalanche warning services provide
critical information about the existing conditions when recre-
ationists are planning their trips from home. We used an on-
line survey to evaluate the impact of avalanche bulletin in-
formation graphics on participants’ ability to apply the infor-
mation to a route ranking exercise that simulated the plan-
ning process for a backcountry trip. We evaluated the graph-
ics on the correctness and completion times of user responses
during the exercise, as well as useability ratings provided by
users. Our study identiﬁed that combining aspect and eleva-
tion information into a single graphic leads to improved suc-
cess on the route ranking exercise, quicker completion times,
and is favoured by users regardless of avalanche training ex-
perience or country of origin. These results can be used by
avalanche warning services seeking to maximize useability
of their bulletins.
This study highlights that simply changing the graphic
presentation of the aspect and elevation information can lead
to greater success in applying the information to a route ﬁnd-
ing task. These research results also provide valuable insight
for the presentation of hazard information beyond avalanches
by demonstrating that linking graphical hazard information
to existing mental models about the hazard can lead to bet-
ter application of the information. This lesson may help to
improve communication of any natural hazard warning in-
formation where applying graphic information is necessary
to make safe decisions.
