one or more observers’ ofﬂine coding. From this consideration derives
the choice of including kinematic but not subjective measures (i.e., video
coding made by an observer) but rather include precise measures of
movement synchronization. Indeed, although a human observer could
detect synchrony happening during interaction, the quantiﬁcation of
such subtle movement dynamics that characterize the construct of
interest would be more accurate and precise if coded by a computer
rather than a human. On the other hand, video-based and/or sensor-
based tracking of kinematic patterns offer a more objective and precise
method for assessing motor synchrony. Using technology and
algorithms to track and analyze movement synchrony also reduces
potential biases and subjectivity associated with human observer coding.
Moreover, studies were eligible for inclusion if the sample consisted
of both an ASD and control group. The deﬁnition of control group as
an inclusion criterion was intended to have at least two types of dyads
to compare, which very often turned out to be TD-ASD vs TD-TD, but
could have embraced ASD-ASD dyads as well. In fact, the idea is that in
order to explore how synchrony works in autism we needed to
compare it with non-autism. Notably, the presence of both ASD and
TD groups in each study that was included is necessary for effect size
calculation purposes. Unfortunately, only n = 1 paper compared TD-
TD with ASD-ASD dyads (60) and we therefore excluded these data
from our analyses to conduct the meta-analysis on a more
homogeneous corpus of studies, whilst its content was included in
our systematic review. The interaction dynamics are in fact
hypothesized to be different here and to test this we would need
more studies with this type of dyad and run moderation analyses, but
unfortunately this was not the case. To minimize heterogeneity of
populations, we excluded studies that recruited participants without
ASD (i.e., siblings of ASD people or neurotypical individuals with
autistic traits). As we were not interested in intervention effects, we
included works that aimed at training IMS but used pre-treatment
measures in our meta-analysis.
Crucially, it is necessary to ﬁnd a balance between narrowing the
focus on a speciﬁc construct and including studies that looked at that
construct with different methods, or that focused on speciﬁc sub-
components (e.g. spontaneous or instructed synchrony, with different
partners). Motor synchrony occurs in a variety of contexts, which can
vary from less to more naturalistic. As we will see, this is reﬂected in
the variety of tasks adopted to study the phenomena. Across tasks
and contexts, an important differentiation is made between
“instructed” and “spontaneous” synchrony, which has been
discussed in the literature and deﬁned in the introductory part of
our paper. We chose not to set constraints as for the type of task and
type of synchrony since IMS itself encompasses a range of nuances,
and all of them are of equal value in contributing to the big picture. If
we did otherwise, we would miss useful information that would
enable a better understanding of how the phenomenon of interest
works. Given our interest towards the analysis of motor synchrony in
human social interactions, we excluded studies assessing synchrony
towards non-human animations, digital characters, or virtual
partners, whilst including in-person human interactions.
The literature selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA ﬂow
diagram (Figure 1). Sixteen studies are included in the systematic review,
while thirteen studies were ultimately selected for meta-analyses.
2.3 Data extraction
For each paper included, the following information was
extracted and registered in a purposely built form:
•

•
sample size, M:F r atio, age (range,
mean,
standard deviation);
•
means and standard deviations of outcome measure (IMS),
separately for ASD and TD groups;
•
experimental conditions, task(s) used to evaluate IMS, type
of synchrony (spontaneous or instructed), number and type
of measures.

All extracted information was recorded by the third author and
checked by the second author. Some of the included papers did not
contain all the information that was required to perform the
analyses, thus corresponding authors were separately contacted by
the ﬁrst author to retrieve speciﬁc missing values.
Crucially, in many studies the authors presented the
participants with batteries of tasks, not all of which aimed to
assess interpersonal motor synchrony. For this reason, we
considered data only from the tasks that were relevant for our
research question.
Importantly, when the selected studies included measures of
asynchrony and reaction times, a subsequent transformation of the
values was necessary to ensure the meaningful interpretability of
effect sizes [e.g., (61–63)]. Speciﬁcally, these measures were
transformed to the negative of their absolute values, establishing a
framework where lower numerical values corresponded to reduced
synchrony. For instance, Yoo and Kim (62) measured asynchrony
centered on the difference between the onset timing of tapping and
cueing; consequently, values approaching zero denoted heightened
synchrony, while both positive and negative values indicated
varying degrees of asynchrony. To obtain a measure that was
representative of synchrony and comparable to the others, we
computed absolute values and subsequently reversed them to
negative. Similarly, Fulceri et al. (61) speciﬁed that their measure
of reaction times revolved around the difference, in milliseconds,
between the Child Start Time and the Experimenter Start Time;
hence, lower values in this context indicated heightened synchrony.
Therefore, when handling reaction times (61, 63) or their coefﬁcient
of variation (61), we also applied negation of the absolute value, as
higher values in this context would otherwise denote asynchrony
rather than of synchrony.
2.4 Statistical approach and analyses
2.4.1 Effect size
Multiple measures were adopted to assess IMS in each study,
meaning a multitude of instruments and measurement scales being
used to assess our outcome measure. As stated in [Borenstein et al.
(64), pp.25], raw mean differences in this case would not be
appropriate to combine the different results, while the
Standardized Mean Difference (d) would provide an effect size
index that is comparable across studies. Given the low to medium
sample size of the considered studies, to estimate d we used the
Hedges’ g, an unbiased estimator that gives less distort results than
the usual Cohen’s d [(64), pp.27]. To calculate the Hedge’s g, the
‘metafor::escalc’ function was used (65). To this point, each study
had multiple effect sizes. These reﬂect a variety of collected
measurements that relate to multiple angles of observation of the
same phenomenon of interest capturing several different facets.
However, considering these effect sizes separately would not be
appropriate, as the measurements they come from are
interdependent (i.e., same study). For this reason, it becomes
necessary to aggregate the effect sizes into a composite one that
quantiﬁes our outcome measure weighting for the multiplicity of
measures that contribute to it. To account for the non-
independency of the effect sizes within each study, we computed
an aggregated effect size for each study adopting the method
suggested by [Borenstein et al. (64), Chapter 24]. To this end, we
used the ‘Mad::agg’ function (66). To use this method the
correlation among outcomes should be known. As this was not
the case for our selected studies, we ran three meta-analyses
hypothesizing three plausible correlations to evaluate whether our
results changed accordingly, as suggested by Borenstein et al. (64).
The same method was used, for example, in Benavides-Varela et al.
(67). Given that the outcomes that were aggregated within each
study were similar from a theoretical point of view it seems
conceivable to us that they correlate strongly. We indicated as
most plausible the value of r = .50 based on Cohen (68) guidelines,
in which a correlation effect of r = .50 is referred to as a large effect
and therefore we hereby report analyses on this speciﬁc case. The
same set of analyses with r = .30 and r = .70 can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.
2.4.2 Statistical analyses
The analyses were conducted with R software (69). In
particular, the ‘metafor’ package (65) was used to perform the
meta-analysis and the subsequent analyses to deepen the obtained
results. A random-effects meta-analytical approach was chosen due
to the number of different laboratories involved and the high
variability in effect size indices. After running the random-effects
models, we explored the heterogeneity between studies through
inspection of forest plot and evaluation of the Q-statistics (70).
Heterogeneity between the studies is indicated by signiﬁcant values
of Q-statistics, which are distributed like the chi-square under the
null hypothesis of homogeneity. To evaluate the extent of
heterogeneity, we considered the I2 (71) and t indexes, as well as
the prediction intervals (72). Although I2 is commonly reported in
meta-analyses as a measure of heterogeneity, it does not tell us how
much the true effects vary but what proportion of the variance in the
observed effects reﬂects variance in true effects rather than sampling
error (73). The estimated amount of total heterogeneity underlying
distribution of true effect sizes is provided by t2, the between-study
variance of the effect size across the population of studies.
Importantly, by looking at t (squared root of estimated t2) we
can quantify the between-study standard deviation.
Complementarily, the prediction interval indicates the range of
value within which the true effect of a new and unique study will fall
in 95% of cases (74).
2.4.3 Sensitivity analysis and evaluation of
publication bias
Various model diagnostic procedures are available to identify
outliers and/or inﬂuential studies, and for conducting sensitivity
analyses, which are recommended to assess whether the ﬁndings are
robust to the decisions made in the process of obtaining them (75).
As the main objective of a meta-analysis is to provide a reasonable
summary of the effect sizes of a body of empirical studies, the
presence of such outliers may distort the conclusions of a meta-
analysis. Moreover, if the conclusions of a meta-analysis hinge on
Carnevali et al.
10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1355068
Frontiers in Psychiatry
frontiersin.org
06
the data of only one or two inﬂuential studies, then the robustness
of the conclusions are called into question (76). The evaluation of
outliers and inﬂuential cases is particularly useful in cases like ours
that are characterized by a low number of studies and where,
therefore, even a single study can have a strong effect on the
estimated effect-size. Since a single outlying study could be the
source of heterogeneity, a recommended method to identify
suspicious cases is the leave-one-out method, which consists in
repeatedly ﬁtting the speciﬁed model, leaving out one study at a
time. Using the’leave1out’ function we explored to which extent
model parameters change when each study is removed from the
sample. The basic rationale behind identifying inﬂuential data is
that when single units are omitted from the data, models based on
these data should not produce substantially different estimates.
Furthermore, we used Cook’s distance to estimate the inﬂuence of
each data point on model parameters, evaluating inﬂuential cases.
More speciﬁcally, Cook’s distance provides further information to
identify inﬂuential data points and complements the information
collected by the previously mentioned method as it quantiﬁes the
change in the meta-analysis parameters when each single study is
removed from the sample (indeed, high values of Cook’s distance
indicate strong inﬂuence on meta-analysis parameters). The
sensitivity analysis we conducted provides a more informative
picture for the reader by transparently clarifying the weight each
study has on the ﬁnal effect size estimate. We further evaluated the
publication bias by means of the funnel plot and using the trim and
ﬁll method, a nonparametric data augmentation technique which
estimates and adjusts the estimates for the potential number and
effect size of missing studies (77, 78).
3 Results
3.1 Systematic review
Although studies show that humans have a natural propensity
to align their behavior during interactions (for review see 2, 6, 13),
the processes by which IMS is achieved could be more or less
explicit. The distinction between spontaneous and instructed
synchrony has been recently scrutinized by Howard et al. (79),
whose ﬁndings underscored that while instructions failed to
enhance synchronization accuracy in adults, they did improve
accuracy among children. One could wonder whether this also
applies to the body of literature in the autism ﬁeld. On the one hand,
instructions should support synchrony as driving participants’
attention to the process itself and thus encouraging an active
effort to achieve it, but they could also be an obstacle whereby
verbal comprehension is limited. On the other hand, spontaneous
paradigms would shed light on low-level synchronization abilities
observable across the whole spectrum.
In the following subsections we delve into the n = 16 studies that
were eligible for review. First, we separately delineate the empirical
ﬁndings pertaining to spontaneous and instructed IMS in dyads
where at least one member is in the autism spectrum; second, we
summarize the measures that were employed to assess synchrony
across the studies. A schematic overview of each study can be found
in Table 2.
3.1.1 Spontaneous IMS
In a dyadic and naturalistic situation with a neurotypical adult,
preschoolers and children with ASD exhibited reduced
synchronization compared to their neurotypical peers (56, 61, 62,
81, 88, 89). Activities could include story reading, drumming, hand
clapping or cooperative games, which were purposely set for
children to be engaged in an ecological interactive setting.
Reduced spontaneous synchronization was also observed during
seated neuropsychological testing and natural conversation in
children (90) as well as in adult conversations (86). The ability to
synchronize with the interaction partner also seems to be negatively
correlated with autistic traits from early ages. In fact, Chen et al.
(81) found that autistic traits especially in the areas of social skills,
communication, and attention switching measured in the ASD
sample are associated with reduced IMS.
One could argue that the quantity and quality of movements
might explain the differences found between groups. Relatedly, Noel
et al. (90) measured movement complexity, duration, and quantity
during the task to shed light on speciﬁc patterns of motion.
Although higher complexity (i.e., non-stereotyped, non-rhythmic,
and not easily predictable) of movements was found in the TD vs
ASD group, no correlation emerged between IMS and any of the
examined factors (90). In line, Georgescu et al. (86) found that the
reduced alignment if the dyad included at least one ASD participant
was not due to the quantity of movement produced, which did not
differ between groups (86). This corpus of research suggests intra-
individual atypicalities in motor abilities not to be enough to explain
the reduction in IMS observed in ASD-TD dyads. Differences in
movement planning could on the other hand inﬂuence IMS. In fact,
in a cooperative joint action task children with ASD showed
reduced coordination with the adult especially when the
destination of the movement was not known beforehand,
suggesting that they struggled more to achieve IMS when having
to rely solely on kinematic features of other’s movement in the
absence of a visual goal (61).
Diminished attention toward the interaction partner could
weaken IMS. Intuitively, the visual anchor of the other supports
IMS as allowing continuous monitoring and adjustment of one’s
movements to the counterpart’s. In fact, studies show enhanced
IMS when visibility of the partner is optimal and decreased when it
is not (81, 84). Crucially though, the content of the activity could
scaffold social attention itself. For instance, when engaged in a book
sharing activity with their caregivers, ASD children devoted less
visual attention to the other their TD peers, but this was attenuated
when using a musical book rather than a picture book, suggesting
musical activity to scaffold mutual engagement (56). Similarly,
Glass and Yuill (60) found that the level of IMS varied across
groups based on the task type. They involved ASD-ASD and TD-
TD children pairs in two joint tablet-based activities and found that
the two groups exhibited comparable IMS in the one activity that
was not designed to deliberately stimulate interaction, while
demonstrating lower IMS in the one activity that was designed to

encourage collaboration and other-awareness. Notably, autistic
children maintained consistent synchronization levels across both
activities, suggesting that in speciﬁc social contexts, they may
possess comparable or heightened synchronization skills (60). To
our knowledge, only one other study looked at ASD-ASD dyads
compared to ASD-TD and TD-TD, but did not ﬁnd an advantage of
neurodevelopmentally homogeneous (over heterogeneous) dyads
on IMS (86). Given the controversial results of these two pivotal
studies (60, 86) further research is needed to examine whether IMS
in ASD-ASD dyads is or is not enhanced, and which factors
contribute to such differences.
3.1.2 Instructed IMS
Motor synchrony is not only a spontaneous mechanism that
facilitates interactions with each other on an implicit level, but it is
also a state that can be pursued intentionally and consciously,
enabling us to achieve speciﬁc goals in shared activities such as
sports, singing and music, as well as play and everyday activities.
Literature suggests that this ability to voluntarily synchronize with
others is reduced in people with ASD from childhood to adulthood
(63, 80, 82–85, 87).
Some studies asked children to perform a series of actions
(either directed to objects, their body, or space) together with the
experimenter and suggested that the target of a movement might
also play a role in one’s ability to synchronize. In fact, children with
ASD showed lower synchronization abilities only in object-directed
movements (83). However, a further implementation of the same
experiment found reduced synchronization in all types of IMS tasks
for the ASD compared to TD children (85). The ability to
voluntarily synchronize with others has also been found
decreased in adolescents with ASD (84) and seems to persist into
adulthood. When instructed to tap two keys back and forth at the
same tempo as that of the partner’s, adult dyads with one ASD
participant showed lower rates of synchronization (87). In line with
literature on spontaneous IMS, movement features do not seem
enough to explain reduced voluntary synchrony. Although slower
and more variable movements in both spacing and timing were
observed in ASD, this only partially related to IMS (85). Similarly,
Brezis et al. (80) found that general motor abilities among
participants with autism accounted for some, but not all, of their
reduced synchrony especially when situated in the follower role. In
the same study, results highlight shorter periods of synchrony in
ASD compared to TD dyads, regardless of leading, following, or
having no pre-speciﬁed role within the interaction (80).
Ultimately, a ﬁrst effort has been done to explore the neural
dynamics that underpin IMS during instructed interaction,
although results appear controversial. More speciﬁcally, Kruppa
et al. (63) used fNIRS to explore brain-to-brain dynamics during a
joint task (cooperative and competitive) and found no group
differences although lower IMS emerged behaviorally for the ASD
group. When looking at individual neural activity with EEG during
a cooperative tapping task, Kawasaki et al. (87) found higher theta-
activity in the frontal cortex in ASD, that was however related to
severity of ASD and difﬁculty to adapt to other’s irregular behaviors
rather than performance on the task itself. Further research is
necessary to shed light on the neural underpinnings of IMS,
especially in autism.
3.1.3 Description of measures adopted to
assess IMS
3.1.3.1 Continuous relative phase
This measure is used in Fitzpatrick et al. (83, 84) and Marsh
et al. (89). It describes the phase space relation between two
segments as it evolves throughout the movement [for review,
(91)]. More speciﬁcally, it measures the angle between two
rhythms in a cycle, meaning that identical movements have 0°
relative phase (in-phase) and opposite movements have 180° phase
(anti-phase). This is done throughout the duration of a movement,
resulting in a time series. In Fitzpatrick et al. (83) 9 relative phases
were deﬁned (from 0° to 180°, by 20°) and their frequency of
occurrence (in percentage) has been computed to evaluate the
predominance of in-phase or anti-phase movements. A similar
approach has been used in Marsh et al. (89): each rocking
segment was weighted by its relative length and 9 relative phases
were considered, in 20° increments arrayed from in-phase (10°
either side of 0°) to anti-phase (10° either side of 180°). From this
measure, the authors calculated the average amount of time a dyad
spends in a given relative phase. Continuous relative phase was also
used in Fitzpatrick et al. (84) to further compute the circular
variance, which indicated the proportion of same relative phases
in the two individuals’ time series. The circular variance of
continuous relative phase is a proportion on a 0-1 continuum
where 1 means perfect synchrony and 0 absence of synchrony.

Motion energy is an automatic frame-differencing method to
quantify movement dynamics by detecting the amount of pixel
changes between consecutive frames (92). One or more regions of
interest (ROIs) in which motion energy is computed are usually
identiﬁed. This measure is used in Liu et al. (56), Georgescu et al.
(86), Noel et al. (90) and Glass and Yuill (60). Different ROIs have been
selected by different groups: Liu et al. (56), as well as Glass and Yuill (60)
selected 2 ROIs only (corresponding to each person) as being interested
in a whole-body coordination, while other groups chose to differentiate
between multiple ROIs within each individual [i.e., head and body in
Georgescu et al. (86); head, hand, trunk in Noel et al. (90)]. After motion
energy is extracted, researchers aiming to assess the strength of the
relationship between the two individuals’ movements commonly
calculate a correlation. Among the studies included in the present
meta-analysis, the correlation can either be a Pearson correlation for
each epoch (~30s) or a windowed cross-correlation of time series (~5s
window) usually followed by a Fisher’s transformation to allow between-
conditions comparisons. Correlation coefﬁcients are then averaged to
obtain a ﬁnal value rather than one value for each time segment.
3.1.3.3 Weighted coherence
The weighted coherence has been deﬁned as the proportion of
shared variance between two systems over an entire band offrequencies
(93) and thus consists in the estimated correlation between partners’
movements. This measure is used in Lampi et al. (88) and Fitzpatrick
Carnevali et al.
10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1355068

10
et al. (85). In both studies, motion tracking systems were used, and a
correlation coefﬁcient has been computed throughout the time series
across the frequency band from 0 to 2 Hz. As the authors stated, the
weighted coherence is a weighted average measure of the correlation of
the two time-series across this frequency range and spans between 0 and
1 (85). The more values are close to zero, the less dyad is in-synch;
conversely, values close to 1 increasingly indicate synchrony
of movements.
3.1.3.4 Other measures
Brezis et al. (80) analyzed the percentage and duration of co-
conﬁdent periods, that are motion segments lasting from 0.2 to 8 sec
during which high synchrony with little jitter (i.e., smooth
movement) is observed. Fulceri et al. (61) adopted three different
measures to assess the extent to which dyads manifested movement
synchrony: reaction times, coefﬁcient of variation of reaction times
and asynchrony of reaching. The ﬁrst refers to the difference
between child and experimenter’s movement start time; the
second corresponds to the ratio between the standard deviation
and the mean of the reaction time; the third is the difference
between the child and experimenter’s movement duration; the
last consists in the time delay between experimenter and child’s
movement end time. Similarly, Yoo and Kim (62) used the
difference between participant’s onset of tapping and external
cueing (i.e., other’s onset of tapping in their interpersonal
synchrony condition), while Kruppa et al. (63) averaged the
absolute differences in response times of each dyad. Another
measure of synchrony that has been used by Kawasaki et al. (87)
consists of rates of synchronized tapping.
3.2 Meta-analysis
3.2.1 Participant details and descriptive statistics
of included studies
Descriptives of the selected works can be found in Table 3. All
the included studies were conducted between 2013 and 2021. The
age range considered spans from children to adolescents and adults.
Most research came from the USA (n = 8 out of 13) and involved a
participant-experimenter interaction (n = 7), while some studies
involved caregiver-child (n = 4) or a participant-participant (n = 2)
dyad. Only one study further included a child-stranger dyad as a
separate condition from parent-child. The type of synchrony
investigated also varies (n = 7 spontaneous, n = 6 instructed).
3.2.2 Random-effects model meta-analysis
The random effects meta-analysis showed a large aggregated
effect size (Hedge’s g = .85, p < 0.001, 95% CI[.35, 1.35], 95% PI[-.89,
2.60]). Although the estimated effect size could be considered large,
the wide width of the conﬁdence interval suggests that also small to
medium effect sizes should be considered consistent with the
observed data. The heterogeneity was signiﬁcant Q(12) = 89.78, p
<.0001, with high values of the I2 index (I2 = 90.06%), t = 0.85 and
PI[-.89,2.60]. Importantly, whilst CI quantiﬁes the accuracy of the
mean and indicates where the mean effect is likely to be, PI
quantiﬁes the dispersion (or distribution) of effect estimates (73,
74). In our case, if 95% CI[.35, 1.35] indicates the uncertainty
around the estimate of the average effect of IMS across the two
populations, 95% PI[-.89,2.60] indicates this as the range of value
within which the true effect of a new and unique study will fall in
95% of cases, further highlighting the variability of the phenomena
of interest. This is also evident from the is between-study standard
deviation we found (t), which is particularly high when compared
to the values commonly reported in meta-analysis pertaining to the
psychology domain (94). In Figure 2, forest plot shows the
aggregated effect sizes for each study as well as the estimate of the
common effect size and the prediction interval.
A moderation analysis on the random-effect model was
performed to explore whether the type of synchrony
(spontaneous vs instructed) inﬂuenced effect size estimates. No
statistically signiﬁcant results emerged: QM(1) = 0.64, p = 0.42.
The set of analyses hereby presented are in line with those
conducted with the other hypothesized correlations of r =.30 and r
=.70, which results are summarized in Table 4 (see SM for details).
3.2.3 Sensitivity analysis and evaluation of
publication bias
Sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method was
performed to evaluate inﬂuential studies that may distort the
effect size estimate. Results are reported in Table 5 and depict the
study from Liu et al. (56) as more inﬂuential than others, decreasing
the effect size estimate. In line, Cook’s distance indicates that the
study from Liu et al. (56) is away from the others (Figure 3).
Although heterogeneity would importantly decrease if excluding
this study, the effect size estimate would still be considered large and
the conﬁdence interval would nevertheless include high values,
therefore we decided not to exclude the study.
To manage publication bias statistically, we graphically
analyzed the funnel plot, drawn after the trim-and-ﬁll method
was implemented (Figure 4).
When accounting for publication bias via the trim-and-ﬁll method,
an even larger effect size (Hedge’s g = 1.17, p < 0.001, 95% CI[.73, 1.60])
was observed. Also, signiﬁcant heterogeneity emerged Q(17)=130.30,
p<.0001, with high values of the I2 index (I2 = 89.40%), t = 0.88 and PI
[-.60, 2.94]. The added studies trend in the direction of the
hypothesized effect, contrary to the expectation in case of publication
bias. Hence, in this case taking publication bias into account even
increases the effect size estimate. This may be due to the relatively
limited number of studies considered, which does not allow for an
appropriate assessment of the publication bias, and especially to the
study by Liu et al. (56), which has an extremely high effect size. Overall,
results from the trim and ﬁll methods do not rule out the presence of
publication bias, although they should be taken with caution.
We further performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether our
results changed according to several imputed plausible correlations, as
suggested by Borenstein et al. (64). The same method was used, for
example, in Benavides-Varela et al. (67). Importantly, all three
correlations and the corresponding three meta-analyses (respectively,
r = .30, r = .50 and r = .70) ultimately lead to essentially the same results
as shown in the Supplementary Material. In conclusion, although we

4 Discussion
Our results suggest there are indeed differences in the extent to
which ASD-TD compared to TD-TD dyads synchronize at a motor
level during interpersonal interactions. Although this is consistent
across studies and supported by the large effect size that emerged
from the meta-analysis, the examined literature also depicts a multitude
of different tasks and measures used to capture IMS in a quite broad age
range and with different interactive partners. Interestingly, the
conﬁdence and prediction intervals from the meta-analysis suggest
that small to medium effect sizes could also be plausible, highlighting
the relevance of discussing the possible reasons for such uncertainty in
spite of a clear direction of the effect. In the following subsections, we
will thoroughly investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in our
results, drawing upon ﬁndings included in our systematic review. This
comprehensive exploration aims to provide insights into the factors
contributing to variations in IMS and paves the way for positive
proposals on what future research can do to ﬁll the gaps in the
existing literature, speciﬁcally encompassing both the intra-personal
and inter-personal foundations of IMS.
4.1 Heterogeneity of measures:
deciphering what movements tell
Given the variability of IMS measures employed in the body of
literature reviewed here, one may ask whether they quantify similar
characteristics of IMS. For instance, some authors used continuous
relative phase to compute (i) the percentage of in-phase segments
(83), (ii) the average amount of time a dyad spends in a given
relative phase (89) or (iii) the circular variance of relative phase
(84). Some other authors computed motion energy across deﬁned
regions of interest and subsequent dyadic cross-correlations (56, 86,
90), and yet others have assessed synchrony by means of weighted
coherence (85, 88). Many other measures have also been employed,
such as the percentage and duration of co-conﬁdent periods (80),
reaction times, coefﬁcient of variation of reaction times, movement
time and asynchrony of reaching (61), differences of response times
(62, 63) and rates of synchronized tapping (87).
As suggested by Schoenherr et al. (95), the speciﬁc aspect of
synchrony being measured relies on the algorithm employed and the
resulting score utilized. Accordingly, the literature on the ﬁeld of
motor development indicates that different motor parameters are
associated with distinct neural activities and inﬂuenced by various
factors such as cognitive, metacognitive, sensory, and social processes
(96–98). However, speciﬁc mappings between measurement methods
and underlying aspects of IMS require further investigation. If we
take acceleration – a motor parameter related to movement
smoothness – as an example, we can see how different measures
tap into its multiple facets. By looking at the rate of acceleration
change over time (99, 100), reach-to-grasp movement smoothness is

Note that the number of dyads refers to the statistical units. For instance, Kruppa et al. (63) had children participants interacting with one of their parents and a stranger. Only children’s age contributed to the values reported in the table and the two interactions were treated
as separate conditions in the present analysis. In two cases, adult participants interacted with each other and therefore the age values reported here refer to all the people involved in interactions. The age values reported for Georgescu et al. (86) are dyadic, meaning that they
come from the average age values of the two components for each pair. Those reported for Kawasaki et al. (87), refer to the TD and ASD participants separately as detailed in the table.

shown to be inﬂuenced by factors like the presence or absence of the
target object, its orientation, and the plane of movement (101). In
turns, neural measures could reveal that movement acceleration
aligns with coherent activation of contralateral primary motor
(M1) hand area and involves dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) for goal-directed
action planning and sensorimotor integration/movement
monitoring (102). Such accurate mapping is far from being
available in relation to IMS. Although there is currently a lack of
comprehensive literature elucidating the exact meaning of each
measure in relation to different aspects of IMS, it is crucial to
exercise caution when combining different measures. Without a
clear understanding of which speciﬁc aspects of IMS each
measurement or task taps into, the interpretation and comparison
of effect sizes across studies can be challenging. To ensure meaningful
comparisons, future research should aim to bridge this gap in
knowledge by investigating the relationships between speciﬁc
measurement methods, the underlying aspects of IMS they capture,
and the resulting variation in observed effect sizes.
4.2 Context matters: towards
naturalistic interactions
The experimental context might also modulate individuals’ ability
to synchronize with others. As the systematic review showed,
researchers relied on a variety of tasks that span from ecological and
spontaneous activities to more controlled experimental contexts. One
could argue that the uncertainty linked to the effect size may relate to
the extent to which the interaction under consideration was ecological.
For example, the study with the largest effect was also the study using
the least structured paradigm (i.e., shared reading activity; 56).
Remarkably enough, this study turns out to be the most inﬂuential
according to sensitivity analyses to the extent that removing it from
the analyses would importantly reduce the between-study
heterogeneity, while the effect size would remain large. Such a
scenario supports the idea that the type of task is indeed what
makes this study different from others, although the phenomena it
measures is the same, and that taking the context into account could
also be key in the study of differences in the ability to synchronize with
others. While the large effect size found by Liu et al. (56) might suggest
an overestimation of the true effect, it could also be that we are dealing
with a general underestimation of the effect size by the other studies
due to a more controlled experimental setting that perhaps does not
always capture the complexity of human exchanges. As highlighted by
multiple authors, synchrony also depends on task demands and the
context in which it is elicited (3, 60, 79).
Since individuals on the autism spectrum seem less sensitive to
changes in the social context while aligning with others (3), they
could possibly beneﬁt from controlled settings while experiencing
enhanced difﬁculties in a daily life context. If this was the case,
controlled contexts might be an important arena to train IMS

especially at early developmental stages, with a view of progressively
expanding to less structured and more ecological situations in
which possible cascading effects on higher-order social skills
could be observed. Indeed, reduced IMS has been suggested as a
proxy for social difﬁculties observed in autism, while the alignment
of bodies has been shown to enhance social exchanges (103). On a
continuum from more naturalistic to controlled setting, one could
also suggest exploring differences between synchronizing with real
vs virtual partners. In fact, literature shows differences between
human and non-human or digital interactions. For instance, social
interactions in VR come with less nuanced non-verbal cues. This
has been shown to lead to changed regulation of interpersonal
behaviors in neurotypical individuals but not in people on the
autism spectrum (57). Exploring motor synchronization abilities of
individuals within the autism spectrum with non-social or less
social partners, such as avatars or digital characters (53, 55) holds
relevance for gaining understanding of human interactions,
particularly in light of potential differences in IMS associated with
the double-empathy problem, as well as on how to enhance motor
synchronization abilities with cascading effects on socio-
cognitive outcomes.
The extent to which experimental settings reﬂect naturalistic
interactions may also be reﬂected in the type of synchrony elicited.
We did not ﬁnd any effect of type of synchrony in our moderation
analyses nor conﬂicting results in the systematic review, but this
might be due to the low number of studies available. Whether the
spontaneous vs induced IMS modulate the effect under
investigation remains therefore an open question. As Howard
et al. (79) interestingly highlighted, instructed synchrony could be
particularly beneﬁcial for children. In their study, they showed that

although social bonding remained consistent across both groups
irrespective of synchrony type, a heightened sense of social
closeness correlated positively with increased synchronization
accuracy in children only (79). While the limited sample of the
current review and meta-analysis did not allow to explore any effect
of age, exploring the interaction between the type of synchrony
elicited and participants’ age in the context of autism and typical
development could constitute an interesting avenue to understand
the origins of diversity. Participants’ age in the included studies
spans from 2 to 51 years and analyzing possible developmental
changes would provide crucial insights on the reasons behind
diversity across the lifespan and in ASD.
4.3 Beyond the individual: an interactive,
inter-personal account of IMS in autism
Most studies have only investigated IMS in ASD-TD vs TD-TD
dyads, with an implicit assumption of diversity in ASD compared to
TD. Indeed, reduced synchrony in ASD-TD dyads is almost always
attributed to intra-individual characteristics of autism and to the
autistic member of the interaction. For example, symptom severity
seems negatively correlated with IMS, in turns predictive of improved
social cognition (85, 104). As autistic traits increase in neurotypical
adults, both spontaneous (49) and induced IMS decrease and this
appears to be modulated by motor difﬁculties (51), as previously
found in ASD population (80). This well-established approach fails to
consider that the neurotypical member of the dyad might itself face
challenges in synchronizing with the neurodiverse member. In line, a
growing number of researchers and members of the autism
community emphasizes how deﬁcit-based research on autism
neglects that misattunement between individuals with and without
ASD is bidirectional and multifaceted, with difﬁculties in interactions
coming from differences in experiencing the world, rather than
autistic deﬁcits (45, 105).
In attempting to explain what may be the reasons that lead to
impaired motor synchrony in ASD-TD dyads, it is crucial to consider
that it is not necessarily the ASD member that has to some extent an
impairment in the ability to synchronize, but that the TD member
itself may have difﬁculty synchronizing with the ASD member
because there are differences in sensorimotor and cognitive
functioning that do not facilitate decoding the signals that the
other is sending, as if each is tuned to different communication
frequencies, or speaks different languages. In other words, we suggest
that individuals tend to synchronize more with those who enable
them to make more accurate predictions more easily.
For example, Noel et al. (90) showed diversity in levels of motor
complexity (stereotyping, rhythmicity, predictability) in individuals in
the spectrum or neurotypicals, and although the authors did not ﬁnd a
correlation between this factor and levels of motor synchrony at the
dyadic level, it is possible that similarity in this parameter contributes
to better synchronization. This means that if there is consistency in the
level of motor complexity of the two interacting individuals, they will
be able to make more accurate predictions and thus synchronize more
easily. To put it simpler, imagine two people trying to have a
conversation, but they speak different languages. It would be
challenging for them to understand each other and ﬁnd common
ground. Similarly, when two individuals with different sensorimotor,
cognitive, socio-emotional, and relational characteristics interact, there
can be a signiﬁcant gap between their understanding of each other.
The same logic can be applied to sensory as well as motor functioning,
that is, if there is similarity in the perception of multisensory cues from
the external (as well as internal) world of the interacting individuals, it
will be more immediate to synchronize because the decoding of the
multisensory cues sent by the other will be easier, somewhat like
speaking the same language. The more the interactive rhythm can be
grasped and decoded similarly among the individuals who are
interacting as a shared communication channel, the more they will
manifest high levels of synchrony. Similarities in sensorimotor
functioning contribute to a form of ingroup which, to note, does
not necessarily correspond with a diagnostic label but rather with a
constellation of functional modalities (106).
Even though reduced IMS has been also found in ASD-ASD
dyads (86), deeper investigations would shed light on whether sharing
similar experiences of the world support synchronization with one
another. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary evidence

provided by Glass and Yuill (60) in their recent work. One could
however argue that the ability to synchronize with others is inherently
related to one’s social skills. In the present work we have not been able
to include social skills as a moderator due to the limited data
available; however future research should carefully consider this
factor. Indeed, independently from being on the autism spectrum
or not, individual differences in social skills might relate to differences
in the ability to synchronize with others, with possible bidirectional
inﬂuences. This perspective would be particularly relevant to gain
insights on intra-personal characteristics contributing to IMS
regardless of neurodevelopmental conditions.
Embracing a Bayesian view, the process of synchronization with
each other can be viewed as a nonlinear probabilistic combination
of social and internal cues, and by the principle of resource
optimization, the individual will tend to align more closely with
those who allow him or her to make more accurate predictions
more easily (39, 40). The concept of similarity (inter-individual
level) in functional characteristics (intra-individual level, i.e.,
sensorimotor, cognitive, socio-emotional functioning) between
two interacting individuals facilitates a more accurate prediction
of each other’s intentions and actions, promoting a smoother
synchronization process. The commonality in internal models
and representations could in fact contribute to greater accuracy of
individuals’ prior, with increasingly less need to update the
predictive model in light of new information. In other words, by
reducing the initial self-other gap, similarity enables more accurate
priors and a more efﬁcient convergence of the predictive model that
in turns scaffolds the synchronization process.
5 Conclusions and future directions
Both our systematic review and meta-analysis shows that ASD-
TD dyads, compared to TD-TD dyads, manifest reduced
synchronization of their behaviors during social interactions,
although high uncertainty emerged as for the true effect size.
Although it is reasonable to believe that many intra-personal (e.g.,
age, sensorimotor, social, and cognitive proﬁles) and inter-personal
factors (e.g., type of synchrony, similarity between the dyad
members) may contribute to reduced IMS found in ASD-TD
exchanges, from the available literature it is not possible to draw
conclusive inferences because they are hardly accounted for.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analytic study on the
topic and crucially contributes to the ﬁeld providing a ﬁrst effort
towards a quantitative synthesis, but the results should be taken
with caution given the limitations herein the available literature (i.e.,
few studies, diverse samples, various measures, theoretical bias in
favor of deﬁcit-based accounts of autism). The conduction of multi-
site studies appears a feasible solution to solve the disparities across
studies that emerged with the present work, as the use of common
protocols and measures would allow a more precise evaluation of
the phenomena of interest, especially including more consistent and
focused age ranges that would the investigation of its developmental
trajectories. Importantly, the current work paves the way for future
research exploring IMS in ASD social interactions, which could
improve perceived social connection and well-being.
