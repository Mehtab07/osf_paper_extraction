## Abstract

Accurately perceiving others’ personalities helps people to successfully navigate their social relationships. However, it is 
not yet clear whether people can accurately perceive one aspect of people’s personalities that may be especially important 
to understand: motivations. Using the fundamental social motives framework, we examined the extent to which people 
accurately perceived a friend’s motivations (vs. big five traits) and how this was related to friendship quality. A sample 
of friend dyads completed both self- and friend-assessments of the big five traits and the fundamental motives, and rated 
friendship quality. Perceivers accurately detected their friend’s unique, self-reported ordering of motives (i.e., distinctive 
accuracy), though to a lesser extent than traits. However, accuracy for motives and traits was positively associated with 
greater friendship quality to a similar extent. Importantly, these associations emerged above and beyond tendencies to view 
others highly normatively, as socially desirable, and as similar to the self.

required, making it ideal when motive-specific hypotheses 
are not present, as in the current study (for further details on 
profile and other approaches, see Back & Nestler, 2016; 
Biesanz, 2010; Borkenau & Leising, 2016). Given that per-
ceptions of the big five traits have been relatively well stud-
ied, we compare how accurately people perceive a friend’s 
traits versus motives. Finally, we examine the extent to which 
perceptions of traits versus motives correspond with friend-
ship quality.
Understanding what another person is like can occur at 
any of three key levels of personality (McAdams, 1996). At 
the broadest level, others’ traits, such as their extraversion 
and neuroticism, can help the perceiver understand a per-
son’s general behavioral tendencies and dispositions. The 
majority of prior research on accurate personality perception 
has been at this level, primarily on traits related to the big 
five (see Funder, 2012, for a brief review; although see 
Cohen, Panter, Turan, Morse, & Kim, 2013). However, the 
second level of personality, which includes goals, strivings, 
and motivations, is also important to understand, as this level 
of personality involves more contextualized information 
about a person and how they are likely to behave. For exam-
ple, knowing that a person is conscientious may lead you to 
expect that they will make and follow through on plans, but 
may not fully indicate whether those plans are geared toward 
achieving higher status at work, finding a romantic partner, 
caring for family members, or something else entirely. Thus, 
fully understanding a person and predicting their behavior 
may involve accurately perceiving not only broader traits but 
also more specific motives. Although motivations may be 
defined in multiple ways, we use the fundamental motives 
framework to operationalize motives, as these may be espe-
cially advantageous to accurately perceive.
Fundamental Motives Framework
The Fundamental Motives approach presumes that human 
motivational systems have been “built” to manage recurrent 
adaptive problems of the past. For human ancestors, social 
life provided many benefits that increased the likelihood that 
their genes would appear in subsequent generations (i.e., 
their inclusive fitness), such as resource sharing and caring 
for a broad network of kin. However, social living also 
brought potential costs to inclusive fitness such as disease, 
loss of status, and interpersonal violence. Those individuals 
who more successfully detected and managed these recurrent 
adaptive problems were more likely to pass their genes onto 
subsequent generations. Thus, human motivational systems 
are constructed in large part to attune to and navigate these 
problems (Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & 
Schaller, 2010; Schaller, Kenrick, Neel, & Neuberg, 2017; 
see also Aunger & Curtis, 2013; Bernard, Mills, Swenson, & 
Walsh, 2005; Buss, 1991; Gigerenzer, 2000; Haselton & 
Nettle, 2006; Hogan, 1996; MacDonald, 1995; McAdams & 
Pals, 2006; McDougall, 1908; Sheldon, 2004). Building 
from developments in evolutionary biology, psychology, and 
anthropology, 
the 
Fundamental 
Motives 
Framework 
(Kenrick et  al., 2010; Schaller et  al., 2017) proposes that 
there are seven fundamental social motives: self-protection, 
disease avoidance, affiliation, status, mate seeking, mate 
retention, and kin care.
These motivations are fundamental in that they are 
thought to characterize the basic structure of human social 
motivation, but because of factors such as life stage and cir-
cumstance, individuals nonetheless differ in the extent to 
which they are motivated to find a mate, avoid physical 
harm, care for family, and so on. Neel, Kenrick, White, and 
Neuberg (2016) generated a pool of items to measure indi-
vidual differences in these motives, conducted factor analy-
ses, and identified multiple factors for the mate retention and 
affiliation motives. Thus, the full set of fundamental social 
motives includes self-protection, disease avoidance, affilia-
tion (group), affiliation (exclusion concern), affiliation (inde-
pendence), status, mate seeking, mate retention (general), 
mate retention (breakup concern), and kin care. Definitions 
and sample items of the fundamental motives are shown in 
Table 1. If the fundamental motives guide human social 
behavior, then accurately detecting others’ motives should 
help a person predict how others will behave, promoting 
cooperation and preventing exploitation (akin to predictions 
from social contract theory; Cosmides, 1985, 1989; Cosmides 
& Tooby, 1989). Thus, people likely possess both the desire 
and ability to detect the fundamental motives in others.
Defining Accuracy, Normativity, Social 
Desirability, and Assumed Similarity
In the current study, we took a componential profile approach 
to examining accuracy for personality traits and motives 
(Biesanz, 2010; Cronbach, 1955; Furr, 2008). Thus, we 
examined the extent to which perceivers’ impressions of a 
target across a series of personality items corresponded with 
target self-reports, our accuracy validation measure. This 
componential approach allows for the assessment of two 
aspects of accuracy: distinctive accuracy and normativity 
(Biesanz, 2010; Furr, 2008), originally termed differential 
accuracy and stereotype accuracy (Cronbach, 1955). 
Distinctive accuracy refers to understanding a target’s unique 
profile of traits and/or motives, those that make them differ-
ent from the average person (e.g., whether a target is more 
motivated by mate seeking than status). By examining agree-
ment at the item level, distinctive accuracy provides a 
nuanced, holistic indicator of a perceiver’s understanding of 
a target’s unique profile of characteristics both across and 
within different motives and traits. For example, two per-
ceivers may both recognize that their friend is more moti-
vated by mate seeking than status in general, but one 
perceiver may recognize that their friend is higher on some 
aspects of status (e.g., desire for respect) than some aspects 
of mate seeking (e.g., spending a lot of time thinking about 
Huelsnitz et al.	
5
ways to meet possible dating partners), thereby demonstrat-
ing even greater accuracy. Furthermore, this indicator of 
accuracy also captures whether the perceiver is able to distin-
guish a target’s standing within a motive or trait, such as 
whether their friend is more concerned with being respected 
than obtaining a position of leadership. As such, distinctive 
accuracy allows for a high level of differentiation in the 
assessment of perceivers’ understanding of their friend’s 
uniqueness. We use the terms distinctive accuracy and accu-
racy interchangeably.
Importantly, distinctive accuracy controls for the extent to 
which self-other agreement could be driven by how norma-
tive perceptions are (Biesanz, 2010; Cronbach, 1955; Furr, 
2008). That is, if most people are driven more by mate seek-
ing than status, a perceiver’s ratings might agree with a tar-
get’s self-report because of this overlap with the normative 
profile, rather than because of an understanding of what 
makes the target unique. Thus, normativity can contribute to 
self-other agreement on average, because people will by def-
inition report being similar to the normative profile on aver-
age, making it a potentially useful and quick route to 
agreement, especially for difficult-to-judge characteristics. 
However, the normative profile tends to be strongly associ-
ated with viewing others positively, as the normative profile 
is highly socially desirable in nature (e.g., Borkenau & 
Zaltauskas, 2009; Wood & Furr, 2016). Of note, recent work 
has demonstrated that normativity and social desirability can 
also be disentangled from one another and have independent 
correlates (Rogers & Biesanz, 2015; Zimmermann, Schindler, 
Klaus, & Leising, 2018) and are therefore not fully inter-
changeable. In the current study, we therefore examine both 
normativity and social desirability by simultaneously exam-
ining the extent to which perceiver impressions correspond 
to the average and socially desirable profiles for both person-
ality traits and motives.
We also examined the role of assumed similarity in per-
ceptions of motives and traits, above and beyond self-other 
agreement, normativity, and social desirability. As such, we 
examine distinctive assumed similarity—the extent to which 
a person views another as sharing one’s unique profile of 
traits and motives (Cronbach, 1955; see also Human & 
Biesanz, 2011b). Of note, by examining assumed similarity, 
distinctive self-other agreement, and normativity simultane-
ously, we are controlling for the extent to which actual dis-
tinctive or normative similarity may contribute to the 
appearance of assumed similarity.
Of note, accuracy and bias in interpersonal perceptions 
can be independent of each other (e.g., Funder & Colvin, 
1997; Gagne & Lydon, 2004). Indeed, although intuitively it 
may seem that accuracy should be negatively linked to nor-
mativity and biases such as assumed similarity and social 
desirability, at times these constructs actually show highly 
similar patterns of correlates. For example, accuracy, norma-
tivity, and assumed similarity are all positively associated 
with greater liking (Human et al., 2013), and accuracy and 
social desirability are both negatively associated with dislike 
(Zimmermann et al., 2018). Thus, although distinctive accu-
racy requires being viewed as different from the normative 
and socially desirable personality profiles, it does not appear 
to imply being viewed more negatively. Furthermore, it does 
not seem to be the case that it is more difficult to accurately 
perceive more normative people because, for example, there

is less distinctive information about such people to detect. 
Instead, people high in well-being tend to have both highly 
normative personality profiles (Wood, Gosling, & Potter, 
2007) and to be seen with high levels of distinctive accuracy 
(e.g., Human & Biesanz, 2011a). Overall, then, distinctive 
accuracy refers to understanding what makes a person unique 
from others, but not necessarily viewing that person more 
negatively or as highly unusual.
Differences in Personality Impressions 
for Motives Versus Traits
Accuracy
Given that substantial prior research has investigated the 
accuracy of personality trait impressions, such as the big five, 
we draw upon research and theory in this subfield to develop 
predictions about the accuracy of motive detection. The real-
istic accuracy model (RAM; Funder, 1995) outlines the four 
stages that must be met for an accurate personality impression 
to be formed: first, relevant cues must be made available to 
perceivers, who must then detect and appropriately utilize 
those cues. Although this model was developed with person-
ality traits in mind, it seems highly likely that, in general, 
accurate motive perception will follow a similar process. As 
such, factors that influence accuracy in perceptions of traits 
may also influence accuracy in perceptions of motives. One 
key category of factors that is argued to influence accuracy 
for traits is characteristics of the traits themselves. Indeed, 
some traits are considered “good traits” (Funder, 1995), in 
that they have characteristics that make them easier to per-
ceive, such as a greater relevance or availability of cues. 
These characteristics may not only help explain why some 
traits may be easier to judge than others but also shed light on 
whether motives in general might be easier or more difficult 
to judge than traits in general. Specifically, in the current 
study, we considered the role of item visibility—the extent to 
which a characteristic has visible, external cues that are read-
ily available for outside observers to perceive (Funder & 
Dobroth, 1987). For example, extraversion is a big five trait 
that is generally high in visibility and which, in turn, tends to 
be seen more accurately than traits that are generally less vis-
ible and instead more internal in nature, such as neuroticism 
(Funder & Dobroth, 1987; John & Robins, 1993; Watson, 
Hubbard, & Wiese, 2000).
In general, motives should be perceived accurately because 
there are likely to be some relevant cues visible to perceivers, 
especially to close friends. Indeed, Neel and colleagues 
(2016) found that fundamental motives predict a wide array 
of specific behavioral outcomes, such as volunteering, going 
out dancing, breaking a bone, and seeing a relationship coun-
selor (see also Bernard, 2009). These relationships hold when 
controlling for big five traits. Thus, a target’s fundamental 
motives have behavioral manifestations that could inform 
accurate perceptions of motives. Furthermore, friends may 
discuss each other’s motives, providing more motive infor-
mation via verbal disclosure. Indeed, people agree with their 
friends and relatives about their motives (Bernard, 2009).
Although motives may on average have some visible 
cues, it is possible that, in general, motives are less visible 
than traits. Indeed, motives often involve internal informa-
tion, such as goals, plans, and desires that may not always 
manifest behaviorally. Thus, although most motives may 
have some external, behavioral manifestations, we argue 
that, on average, motives are likely to be less visible than 
traits, and therefore, accuracy for motives is likely to be 
lower than accuracy for traits. This is in line with recent 
work on self-informant agreement regarding motivational 
themes in a person’s freely listed goals, which found low and 
generally nonsignificant levels of agreement (Dunlop et al., 
2017), suggesting that such information may indeed be more 
difficult to judge than traits.
Normativity and Assumed Similarity
Differences in visibility may not only influence accuracy but 
also affect other components of personality impressions, 
including normativity and assumed similarity. Specifically, 
both normativity and assumed similarity tend to be higher 
when information is more limited. For example, in line with 
predictions from Kenny’s (1991, 1994) weighted average 
model (WAM), as acquaintanceship increases, accuracy tends 
to increase but normativity tends to decrease, presumably 
because greater access to information reduces reliance on nor-
mative information (Biesanz, West, & Millevoi, 2007).
Relatedly, the self-based heuristic—a tendency to fill in 
the gaps with self-information when other-information is 
limited (Ready, Clark, Watson, & Westerhouse, 2000)—con-
tributes to assumed similarity. When it is difficult to judge a 
specific trait because it is lower in visibility, people rely 
more on self-information and therefore assume more similar-
ity (Beer & Watson, 2008; Watson et al., 2000). Indeed, when 
asked to list what a close other’s goals are, informants tend to 
project their own goals (Dunlop et al., 2017). For motives, 
then, assumed similarity is likely to be substantial and may 
be higher than accuracy.
Social Desirability
It is less clear whether visibility would influence how posi-
tively friends view one another. Much like assumed similarity, 
people may rely on a bias like social desirability when they 
have limited information, suggesting that if motives are less 
visible, friends may be more likely to project positive charac-
teristics onto one another. Nevertheless, people view close 
others with high levels of social desirability even when a per-
son’s true characteristics, including flaws, are clearly visible, 
arguably because of motivational processes to view the other 
positively (e.g., Murray & Holmes, 1993). Thus, if viewing 
another person positively is driven more by motivational than 
Huelsnitz et al.	
7
informational processes, this tendency may be independent of 
how visible the characteristics are. As such, we have no spe-
cific expectation about how item visibility corresponds to the 
social desirability of impressions of motives.
Personality Impressions and Friendship 
Quality
Relationships may function well when each person accu-
rately perceives the other. Indeed, accurate perceptions of 
traits are linked to greater liking (Human et al., 2018; Human 
et al., 2013; Zimmermann et al., 2018) and romantic relation-
ship satisfaction (Luo & Snider, 2009; Neff & Karney, 2005). 
We examined whether perceptions of friends’ motives—
whether accuracy, normativity, social desirability, or assumed 
similarity of motives—may likewise correspond to positive 
relationship processes among friends.
Accuracy
Friends should be particularly motivated to accurately detect 
one another’s motives, and accuracy, or a lack thereof, could 
be quite consequential for the friendship, for several reasons. 
First, accurate motive perceptions could facilitate goal 
achievement. If a target wants to find a new romantic partner, 
for example, having a friend who understands and supports 
that goal could benefit their friendship as well as the target’s 
ability to achieve that goal (i.e., could promote goal interde-
pendence; see Fitzsimons, Finkel, & Vandellen, 2015). 
Second, in all types of close relationships, people value being 
understood by their relationship partner. The feeling that one 
is perceived accurately (or that one is perceived according to 
one’s own beliefs about oneself) is important for promoting 
intimacy in the relationship (e.g., Swann, De La Ronde, & 
Hixon, 1994). People also want to feel as though they know 
their relationship partners (De La Ronde & Swann, 1998). To 
the extent that a person’s motivations are an important part of 
their identity, accurate motive perceptions may therefore 
benefit the relationship through processes such as self- and 
partner-verification (De La Ronde & Swann, 1998; Swann 
et al., 1994). Overall, then, we expect that greater accuracy 
for motives will be associated with greater friendship quality, 
from the perspective of both the perceiver and the target.
Normativity, Social Desirability, and Assumed 
Similarity
There is also evidence that viewing others normatively, posi-
tively, and with assumed similarity is linked to positive rela-
tional processes. Specifically, liking an acquaintance is 
related to viewing that person’s personality traits more nor-
matively (Human et  al., 2018; Human et  al., 2013), more 
positively (Rogers & Biesanz, 2015; Wessels, Zimmermann, 
Biesanz, & Leising, 2018; Zimmermann et al., 2018), and 
with greater assumed similarity (Human & Biesanz, 2011b; 
Human et al., 2013; Morry, 2007; Selfhout, Denissen, Branje, 
& Meeus, 2009; Sunnafrank & Ramirez, 2004). Thus, we 
also examined whether seeing others’ motives normatively, 
positively, and with assumed similarity is similarly linked to 
friendship quality.
The Current Research
To examine whether friends perceive each other’s motives 
with distinctive accuracy, we recruited friend dyads to com-
plete assessments of the fundamental motives and big five 
personality traits for themselves and each other. We antici-
pated that friends would accurately perceive each other’s 
fundamental motives, although to a lesser extent than their 
personality traits, given their likely lower visibility. We also 
expected that friends would view each other’s motives nor-
matively and with assumed similarity, possibly more so than 
traits, but we did not have firm predictions about how social 
desirability in perceptions of motives would differ from 
traits. Finally, we expected that accuracy, normativity, social 
desirability, and assumed similarity for both motives and 
traits would all be related to greater friendship quality, but 
we did not have predictions regarding whether the links 
would be stronger for one level of personality than another.

## Method

Participants
A total of 264 participants were recruited across two waves 
of data collection to participate in a fully dyadic study, 
including one sample of undergraduate students (N = 130 
people, 65 dyads) and one community sample (N = 132 peo-
ple, 66 dyads),1 resulting in a final sample of 262 participants 
(131 dyads; see Table 2 for demographic information). The 
study took place at a large Midwestern university. Participants 
were compensated with their choice of either a US$10 gift 
card or, for the undergraduate students, course credit.
Data from both samples were analyzed together, and there 
were very few cases where sample significantly moderated 
the associations reported below. Furthermore, even when 
significant differences emerged, the pattern of results was 
highly similar. The results reported below were also highly 
consistent controlling for participant age and gender, so we 
did not include these as control variables in the analyses 
reported below.

aAlthough we specifically recruited friends for the undergraduate sample data collection (which took place before the community sample data collection), 
some participants indicated to researchers that they were in other types of relationships with the friend they brought to the lab (e.g., roommates, co-
workers). Thus, when the community sample data collection took place, we assessed the type of relationship. Although most participants indicated their 
relationship with their counterpart was a friendship (81.3%), other types of relationships were reported as well, such as romantic relationships (23.1%), 
co-workers/colleagues (11.9%), roommates (3.7%), relatives (3%), and other relationships, such as neighbors (3.7%).

samples, participants were asked to come to the lab with a 
friend to participate in a study on social motivations and 
friendship. Friend was defined as
a person whom you are not related to, but whom you have a 
relationship with of some form. This can be someone you’ve 
known only a short time, or your whole life, and you can feel 
any level of closeness to that person.
Once the friend dyads arrived at the lab, they sat at comput-
ers in separate rooms and completed two self-assessments: a 
version of the Fundamental Social Motives Inventory (FSMI; 
Neel et al., 2016) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John & 
Srivastava, 1999). Next, participants completed observer 
report versions of the scales, referencing their friend. Then, 
participants completed measures of friendship quality.2 
Finally, each participant provided demographic information.
Measures
See Table 2 for descriptive statistics and internal reliability 
estimates on the following measures.
Personality.  The BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999) was used to 
assess personality traits. The BFI comprises 44 items assess-
ing five personality dimensions (openness [e.g., “Has an active 
imagination”], conscientiousness [e.g., “Makes plans and fol-
lows through with them”], extraversion [e.g., “Is outgoing, 
sociable”], agreeableness [e.g., “Likes to cooperate with oth-
ers”], and neuroticism/emotional stability [e.g., “Worries a 
lot”]). Participants are asked to indicate their agreement with 
each statement on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly 
disagree to 7 = strongly agree). Averaged across samples and 
subscales, the reliability estimate of the BFI was α = .80, 
which is comparable with past reliability estimates found for 
the BFI (α = .76; Barrick & Mount, 1991).
Social motivations.  We used 66 items from an expanded version 
of the FSMI (Neel et  al., 2016) to assess 10 fundamental 
motives (self-protection, disease avoidance, affiliation 
[group], affiliation [exclusion concern], affiliation [indepen-
dence], status, mate seeking, mate retention [general], mate 
retention [breakup concern], kin care [family]; given the low 
number of participants in our sample likely to have children, 
we excluded items measuring the kin care [child] motive). The 
version we used includes all 60 items from the 2016 FSMI that 
measure these 10 motives, as well as two additional items for 
affiliation (exclusion concern), one for affiliation (indepen-
dence), two for status, and one for kin care (family) that were 
part of the measure at the time of data collection (2013-2014). 
See Table 1 for sample items and definitions of each motive. 
Participants are asked to indicate their agreement with each 
statement in general currently (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = 
strongly agree). For each of the 10 fundamental motives, there 
were six to eight items reflecting each motive, which were 
averaged to form composite subscale scores. Averaged across 
samples and subscales, the reliability estimate of the FSMI 
ranged from α = .68 (mate retention—general) to α = .91 
(mate retention—breakup concern), which is comparable to 
past reliability estimates found for the FSMI (α = .78 [status 
and mate retention—general] to α = .94 [mate retention—
breakup concern; Neel et al., 2016).
Friendship quality.  The Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS; 
Bukowski, Hoza, & Boivin, 1994) comprises five scales with 
four items each that assess companionship, conflict, help, 
security, and closeness in friendships. Participants are asked 
to indicate the extent to which the statement is true or untrue 
on a 7-point response scale, with responses ranging from 1 = 
not true to 7 = really true. These scales were aggregated to 
form a single composite measure of friendship quality and 
then the measure was standardized (α = .85). Bukowski and 
colleagues found reliability estimates (Cronbach’s α) for the 
FQS subscales ranging from .71 to .86.3
Assessing visibility and social desirability.  A separate sample of 
123 undergraduates provided ratings of trait and motive vis-
ibility and desirability (see Table 2 for demographic informa-
tion). Undergraduates were recruited through the psychology 
department subject pool and rated the observability (1 = not 
at all observable to 7 = extremely observable) and social 
desirability (1 = not at all desirable to 7 = extremely desir-
able) of all items in the FSMI and BFI (counterbalanced) and 
provided demographic information.
Analytic Approach
Data were analyzed following the social accuracy model 
procedures (Biesanz, 2010; see Human & Biesanz, 2011b, 
for detailed empirical examples) using R’s lme4 package 
(Bates, Machler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015; R Development 
Core Team, 2006). The raw data files and R code for all 
primary and supplementary analyses can be found on the 
Open Science Framework (OSF): osf.io/ns4h9/?view_only
=0d1ccb89fd40486eb6a8783aa28a7fdd. 
This 
modeling 
approach is ideal for the current study as it allows for the 
assessment of each personality impression component of 
interest within the same model, thereby enabling us to 
examine and control for each in a single analysis. This 
approach therefore incorporates substantial data within each 
analysis, making it both high in statistical power and con-
cise, allowing us to simultaneously examine multiple, theo-
retically meaningful personality impression components, as 
well as possible correlates of each.
To assess distinctive accuracy, normativity, social desirabil-
ity, and distinctive assumed similarity with this model, a multi-
level regression model was examined with four predictors of 
perceiver impressions: the distinctive accuracy validation mea-
sure (the target’s self-report on each item), the normative accu-
racy validation measure (the mean self-report on each item), 
10	
Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 46(1)
the social desirability validation measure (the mean social 
desirability rating of each item), and the assumed similarity 
validation measure (the perceiver’s self-report on each item). 
See Figure 1 for visual depiction of the model. Prior to analy-
ses, we within-item centered the distinctive accuracy and 
assumed similarity validity profiles by subtracting the mean 
self-report on each item to ensure orthogonal predictors, and 
then all profiles were grand-mean centered to assist with model 
interpretation and convergence (see Biesanz, 2010, for detailed 
discussion of centering in social accuracy model [SAM] of 
interpersonal perception). Each perceptual tendency was 
allowed to vary randomly across perceivers as follows:

Here, Yik is perceiver i’s rating of their friend on item k, 
TSelfik is perceiver i’s friend’s self-report on item k after 
partialling out the normative profile, Normk is an estimate of 
the normative profile based on the mean self-report on item 
k across all participants (items are not reverse coded), Posk 
is an estimate of the positive personality profile based on the 
mean social desirability rating on item k across all raters, 
and the perceiver’s own personality PSelfik is perceiver i’s 
self-report on item k. Thus, β1i reflects distinctive accuracy, 
the extent to which targets’ unique self-reported characteris-
tics (i.e., the characteristics that differentiate the target from 
the average person) predict perceivers’ ratings of that target, 
on average across all perceivers. β2i reflects the extent to 
which the mean self-report predicts perceivers’ ratings of 
their friend or the average level of normativity across per-
ceivers. The regression coefficient β3i reflects the average 
level of social desirability across perceivers, the extent to 
which the mean social desirability rating predicts perceiv-
ers’ ratings of their friend. Finally, β4i reflects distinctive 
assumed similarity, the extent to which perceivers’ own 
unique traits predict perceivers’ ratings of their friend, on 
average across perceivers, controlling for actual similarity 
(the target in dyad j’s self-report on item k), normative simi-
larity (the mean target self-report), and social desirability 
(the mean social desirability rating).
The coefficients β00, β10, β20, β30, β40 in Equation 1.2 rep-
resent the fixed effects or the average intercept, distinctive 
accuracy, normativity, social desirability, and assumed simi-
larity slopes, respectively, across both perceivers and items. 
The us reflect the perceiver random effects in terms of devia-
tions from the fixed effects. Specifically, u1i is perceiver i’s 
unique distinctive accuracy slope, u2i is perceiver i’s unique 
normativity slope, u3i is perceiver i’s unique social desirabil-
ity slope, and u4i is perceiver i’s unique assumed similarity 
slope. The random effect values for each perceiver are not 
directly estimated—instead the variance of the us across per-
ceivers is estimated (represented by τ in Table 3), providing 
an index of how much perceivers varied from one another in 
their accuracy, normativity, social desirability, and assumed 
similarity. However, given that perceivers only rated one tar-
get (their friend), we could not disentangle the extent to 
which the random effects variance was due to perceivers or 
Figure 1.  The social accuracy model expanded to include social desirability and distinctive assumed similarity.

targets, as these are fully redundant. In other words, because 
each participant only rated one target and was only rated by 
one perceiver, we cannot determine whether accuracy levels, 
for example, were driven by variability in perceiver ability 
versus target expressivity.
Furthermore, because participants were nested within 
dyads and the data were fully dyadic (all participants were 
both a perceiver and a target), it was possible to allow inter-
cepts and slopes to vary randomly by dyad (i.e., allow for the 
errors variances of the two members of each dyad to be cor-
related), to account for the dependence that may come from 
friends rating each other (i.e., friends’ rating styles may be 
more similar to each other than strangers’). However, though 
generally significant, dyadic random effect variance was 
very small and their inclusion contributed to model conver-
gence issues. Thus, in line with a recent guide to using SAM 
with dyadic data (Rogers, Wood, & Furr, 2018), the final 
models only included perceiver random effects, although the 
pattern of results was highly similar when dyadic random 
effects were included.
To examine whether levels of accuracy (and normativity, 
social desirability, and assumed similarity) differ for percep-
tions of traits versus motives, we included a dummy variable 
(Motivek) indicating whether each item k was either a trait (= 
0) or a motive (= 1) as a moderator variable predicting each 
interpersonal perception component, as follows:

The unstandardized coefficients β11, β21, β31, and β41 repre-
sent the interaction between whether the item was a trait or 
motive and distinctive accuracy, normativity, social desir-
ability, and assumed similarity, respectively. Specifically, 
positive values for estimates of β11, β21, β31, and β41 would 
indicate that distinctive accuracy, normativity, social desir-
ability, and assumed similarity, respectively, were greater for 
motives versus traits. In exploratory analyses, we also exam-
ined whether there were differences in levels of accuracy for 
each trait and motive, relative to the average of all of traits 
and motives, respectively—see supplementary online mate-
rials (SOM) and OSF: osf.io/ns4h9/?view_only=0d1ccb89fd
40486eb6a8783aa28a7fdd.
A similar approach was taken to examine the role of trait 
visibility. Specifically, the mean item visibility rating was 
included as a moderator predicting each component of 
impressions. This allowed us to examine whether levels of 
accuracy were greater for items that were rated as more vis-
ible. Furthermore, by including both the trait versus motive 
dummy-coded variable and item visibility as moderators 
within the same model, we could examine whether item vis-
ibility contributed to any differences in impressions for traits 
versus motives.
To examine how friendship quality was associated with 
accuracy, normativity, social desirability, and assumed sim-
ilarity, perceiver- or target-rated quality was again included 
as a moderator or a predictor of each slope. We also exam-
ined whether the links between perceiver and target friend-
ship quality and impressions were moderated by whether 
perceptions were of traits or motives by including the 
dummy-coded trait versus motive variable as an additional 
moderator and examining the three-way interactions 
between the target’s validity measure, friendship quality, 
and trait versus motive code predicting perceiver impres-
sions. A significant positive three-way interaction would 
indicate that the association between accuracy, for exam-
ple, and friendship quality was stronger for motives com-
pared with traits.
We do not report effect size estimates for the overall levels 
of accuracy, normativity, social desirability, and assumed 
similarity because there is not an established method for 
doing so for these Level 1 effects. Instead, in the discussion, 
we descriptively compare the Level 1 effects with past work 
examining accuracy, normativity, and assumed similarity for 
perceptions of traits using similar rating scales and modeling

approaches. Furthermore, we have included standardized 
effect size estimates (ds) for the key Level 2 analyses examin-
ing the links between accuracy, normativity, social desirabil-
ity, and assumed similarity and moderators including traits 
versus motives, item visibility, and friendship quality. For 
continuous moderators such as friendship quality, ds were 
calculated as the change in the accuracy slope for a 2-standard 
deviation (SD) change in the moderator, divided by the per-
ceiver random effect estimate SD for that slope, to make esti-
mates comparable with Cohen’s d (see Gelman, 2008). To 
obtain confidence intervals (CIs), we computed bootstrapped 
CIs using 500 parametric resamples from the model.
Overall, then, using SAM allows us to (a) simultaneously 
assess levels of distinctive accuracy, normativity, social 
desirability, and assumed similarity for traits and motives; 
(b) examine whether levels differ for traits versus motives 
and whether differences are driven by item visibility; and (c) 
whether distinctive accuracy, normativity, social desirability, 
and assumed similarity are associated with friendship quality 
and whether the links differ for traits versus motives.
Sensitivity analysis.  We used the fabs package for R (github\
jbiesanz\fabs) to compute expected power. Given that effect 
size estimates for the Level 1 effects are not available, we 
used the association between accuracy for personality traits 
and liking among new acquaintances in Human and Biesanz 
(2011b) as an initial effect size estimate for the key Level 2 
effect of whether accuracy would be associated with greater 
friendship quality. This also provides a more conservative 
power estimate given that it is based on detecting a modera-
tion effect. Human and Biesanz (2011b) found a medium 
effect (d = .46) between accuracy and liking with a sample 
of 107 participants. According to these calculations, which 
incorporate the uncertainty associated with this effect size 
estimate, this study has an expected power of .91 with a sam-
ple of 262 (see Biesanz & Schrager, 2017; McShane & Böck-
enholt, 2016).

## Results

Mean levels.  We first examined components of personality 
impressions across both traits and motives (see Table 3, fixed 
effects). Indeed, participants were able to accurately per-
ceive their friend’s unique, self-reported ordering of traits 
and motives (distinctive accuracy), tended to perceive their 
friend’s traits and motives as similar to the normative per-
sonality profile (normativity) and socially desirable person-
ality profile, and tended to assume their friend shared their 
own unique traits and motives, above and beyond actual 
similarity (distinctive assumed similarity). Personality 
impressions were substantially similar to the normative pro-
file—indicated by larger b values for normativity—while 
also demonstrating lower but significant levels of accuracy, 
social desirability, and assumed similarity.
There were significant and similar levels of variance in 
accuracy, normativity, social desirability, and assumed simi-
larity (see Table 3, random effects). Thus, there was substan-
tial variation in the extent to which perceivers viewed targets 
accurately, normatively, positively, and as similar to the self.
Traits versus motives.  Did levels of accuracy differ for traits 
versus motives? As anticipated, motives were less accurately 
judged than personality traits (see Table 4, separate analy-
ses). Furthermore, motives were seen more normatively and 
with greater assumed similarity than were traits. Finally, 
social desirability contributed less to friends’ perceptions of 
motives than of traits.
Role of item visibility.  If motives are less visible than traits, 
this could contribute to the different levels of accuracy, nor-
mativity, and assumed similarity for motives versus traits 
observed above. Indeed, motive items were on average rated 
as less visible than big five trait items, b = –.69, z = −8.38, 
p < .001. Furthermore, item visibility was associated with 
significantly greater accuracy and lower normativity and 
assumed similarity (see Table 4, separate analyses). In turn, 
when controlling for item visibility, the effects of motives 
versus traits on accuracy and assumed similarity remained 
significant but the magnitude of the effects did reduce quite 
substantially, by roughly half (see Table 4, combined analy-
ses). Furthermore, the difference between traits and motives 
on normativity was no longer significant. Meanwhile, the 
effects of item visibility remained significant and of a similar 
magnitude. Thus, the lower visibility of motives may partly 
explain why friends perceive this aspect of personality less 
accurately and utilize more normative and self-information 
when making these judgments. Items that were higher in vis-
ibility also, unexpectedly, were rated more positively and 
controlling for item visibility also reduced the magnitude of 
this effect.
Associations with friendship quality.  Does accuracy tend to be 
greater in higher quality friendships? More accurate percep-
tions of a friend’s motives were significantly associated with 
greater perceiver- and target-rated friendship quality (see 
Table 5, accuracy row). Unlike prior research, accuracy for 
traits was not significantly associated with greater perceiver- 
or target-rated friendship quality. However, the links between 
accuracy and friendship quality did not differ significantly as 
a function of traits versus motives.4
Forming more normative impressions of motives and 
traits, even after controlling for the social desirability of 
impressions, was associated with greater perceiver- and tar-
get-rated friendship quality, and these associations were not 
significantly different for traits versus motives (see Table 5, 
normativity row). Somewhat surprisingly, viewing a friend’s 
personality as more socially desirable, controlling for the 
normativity of impressions, was not significantly associated 
Huelsnitz et al.	
13
with greater friendship quality for either traits or motives 
(see Table 5, social desirability row).
Finally, greater assumed similarity was associated with 
greater perceiver-rated friendship quality for both traits and 
motives, although the association did tend be larger for 
motives (see Table 5, assumed similarity row). Being viewed 
with assumed similarity was significantly associated with 
target-rated friendship quality for motives but not traits, and 
this difference was significant.
Overall, then, accuracy, normativity, and assumed simi-
larity in perceptions of traits and motives all showed some 
positive associations with perceiver- and/or target-reported 
friendship quality. Generally the strength of the associations 
did not significantly differ for traits versus motives, but when 
differences did emerge, associations tended to be stronger for 
motives than traits. Not only did these associations emerge 
above and beyond the role of positive impressions, social 
desirability was not independently significantly associated 
with friendship quality for either traits or motives.

## Discussion

Knowing another person’s social motivations—whether they 
want to form a new romantic relationship or to maintain an 
existing one, to affiliate with other people or to avoid them, or 
to obtain status or to blend into the social hierarchy—is useful 
for predicting that person’s behavior, as well as for managing 
one’s relationship to that person. We would expect, then, that 
people seek to perceive one another’s motivations and are 
able to do so with some accuracy. At the same time, because 
motivations involve internal information such as thoughts, 
desires, and plans, they may be more difficult to perceive than 
personality traits. Indeed, we found that perceivers accurately 
detected their friend’s unique, self-reported ordering of 
motives (i.e., showing distinctive accuracy), though to a 
lesser extent than for the big five traits. Furthermore, consis-
tent with the idea that accurate motive perception should ben-
efit relationship processes, we found that greater accuracy for 
motives was associated with greater perceiver- and target-
rated friendship quality. These associations emerged above 
and beyond normativity, social desirability, and assumed 
similarity in perceptions of traits and motives. We elaborate 
upon each of these findings below.
Levels and Differences in Personality Impressions 
for Motives Versus Traits
Accuracy.  Perceivers on average agreed with targets about 
the target’s unique ordering of motives (i.e., they exhibited 
distinctive accuracy). Compared with levels of accuracy in 
first impressions (b = .10; Human et al., 2013), levels of 
distinctive accuracy in the current study for both traits (b = 
.29) and motives (b = .23) were much higher, as would be 
expected with well-acquainted dyads. However, although 
quite high, average levels of accuracy for motives were sig-
nificantly lower than average levels of accuracy for traits. 
This was partially driven by visibility: As expected, motives 
tended to be rated as less observable to others. In turn, lower 
item visibility was associated with forming less accurate 
impressions, in line with past work (Funder & Dobroth, 
1987; John & Robins, 1993; Watson et al., 2000). Finally, 
controlling for item visibility substantially reduced the dif-
ference in accuracy for traits versus motives. Thus, although 
motives can be accurately detected by friends, they are likely 
to be harder to perceive than traits, on average, because they 
tend to be less visible to others.

However, item visibility did not entirely account for the 
differences in accuracy between traits and motives, suggest-
ing that other factors may contribute to lower accuracy for 
motives than for traits. For example, motives may be more 
specific or contextualized than broad personality traits, 
which may decrease the relevance and availability of cues 
because there may be fewer contexts in which relevant cues 
may emerge. For example, whereas an individual who is 
extroverted may tell jokes, be talkative, and be likely to start 
conversations across a range of situations, a heterosexual 
woman who is motivated to obtain a romantic partner may 
tell jokes to men, be talkative in front of men, and be likely to 
start conversations with men. Thus, even a well-acquainted 
perceiver may have less accuracy for a target’s motives than 
personality traits if they do not see them in situations that 
would enable a particular motive to be expressed.
In addition, although the big five traits generally show 
high stability over time (e.g., Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005; 
McCrae & Costa, 1994), motives may also be harder to judge 
because they may be more susceptible to change as a func-
tion of age and life circumstances (Neel et al., 2016). For 
example, socioemotional selectivity theory (e.g., Carstensen, 
1991; Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999) suggests that 
as people age, they experience motivational shifts, such as 
being more motivated to pursue new relationships in young 
adulthood and more likely to maintain close relationships 
and exclude new social partners in older adulthood 
(Carstensen, 1992). Long- and short-term temporal shifts in 
motivation may mean that even among well-acquainted 
pairs, accurate motive detection would be more challenging 
than personality detection.
Thus far, we have considered differences between motives 
and traits at the aggregate level, examining how accuracy for 
motives on average differs from accuracy for traits on aver-
age. However, there is of course variability within both traits 
and motives in terms of their visibility and other characteris-
tics, which may also contribute to differences in levels of 
accuracy. Indeed, in exploratory analyses, we found that 
some motives and traits tended to be viewed more accurately 
than others (see SOM). However, given the early stage of 
research on accurate motive detection, and the large number 
of analyses required to look at specific motives, we hesitate 
to draw strong conclusions about levels of accuracy for indi-
vidual motives. Instead, we hope that future work will build 
upon these initial findings to better understand the factors 
that influence accuracy for motives in general, as well as spe-
cific motives.
Normativity.  Friends viewed each other highly normatively 
on average, for both traits (b = .80) and motives (b = .84), 
at similar, if slightly lower, levels to those seen in first 
impressions contexts (e.g., b = .90; Human et al., 2013). 
However, the levels of normativity in friends’ perceptions of 
motives were significantly greater than in their perceptions 
of traits. This also appeared to be driven by the lower 
visibility of motives versus traits, as there was no longer a 
significant difference in normativity between motives and 
traits when controlling for item visibility. This suggests that, 
given the lower visibility of motives, people are more likely 
to rely on and fill in any gaps in their knowledge with nor-
mative information when judging motives. This is in line 
with past work finding that normativity tends to be greater at 
lower levels of acquaintanceship (Biesanz et  al., 2007). 
However, to our knowledge, this is the first research to show 
item visibility specifically contributes to the use of greater 
normative knowledge.
Assumed similarity.  We found that perceivers tended to 
assume their friend shared their own unique motives. This is 
consistent with past work suggesting that people view others 
as similar to the self, including on motivational characteris-
tics such as goals (Dunlop et al., 2017). Levels of assumed 
similarity for motives among friends (b = .25) tended to be 
higher than those seen for traits in first impressions settings 
(e.g., b = .10; Human et al., 2013) and for assumed similar-
ity for traits among friends in the current study (b = .15). 
The difference in assumed similarity for traits versus motives 
again appeared to be partially driven by the lower visibility 
of motives. That is, the lower visibility of motives suggests 
that perceivers lack other information about specific motives 
and therefore rely on self-information (Ready et al., 2000) to 
supplement their knowledge of the target, just as people do 
when judging harder-to-read personality traits (Beer & Wat-
son, 2008; Dawes, 1990; Watson et  al., 2000). However, 
although controlling for item visibility did quite strongly 
contribute to the differences in assumed similarity for 
motives versus traits, it did not entirely account for these dif-
ferences, suggesting there may be other factors at play that 
may account for the difference. As with accuracy, it may also 
be that greater change in motives across situations and time 
contributes to the reliance on more self-information to fill in 
the gaps. However, it is also possible that motivational pro-
cesses, such as wanting to believe that one shares similar 
motives more so than traits, could also account for these dif-
ferences. This is a question for future research.
Social desirability.  Friends also viewed each other in line with 
the socially desirable personality profile, although the levels 
were lower than seen in face-to-face first impressions 
research (bs = .54-.63; Rogers & Biesanz, 2015), and were 
lower for motives (b = .07) than traits (b = .25). Item visibil-
ity also appeared to contribute to the difference between 
motives and traits, suggesting that people may be less likely 
to utilize positive information when judging characteristics 
that are less visible. However, it is unclear why this would 
be, and item visibility did not fully account for this differ-
ence. As such, additional research is needed to better under-
stand why friends are more likely to view each other’s traits 
versus motives in line with the socially desirable profile and 
what role item visibility plays in this.

Links With Friendship Quality
Accuracy.  Given that accuracy for motives may facilitate inti-
macy (e.g., De La Ronde & Swann, 1998; Swann et  al., 
1994), we also predicted (and found) that higher accuracy for 
motives corresponds to better friendship quality. Indeed, 
both seeing one’s friend accurately and being seen accurately 
by one’s friend were significantly associated with better 
friendship quality. This is consistent with past work finding 
that accuracy for personality traits is linked to positive rela-
tional processes (Human et al., 2018; Human et al., 2013; 
Luo & Snider, 2009; Neff & Karney, 2005), even though in 
the current study we did not find that accuracy for traits was 
associated with greater friendship quality (although the asso-
ciations between friendship quality and accuracy did not sig-
nificantly differ for motives vs. traits).
Greater friendship quality may also promote greater accu-
racy (Zimmermann et al., 2018). Greater friendship quality 
may lead friends to exchange more intimate and high quality 
information, thereby promoting accuracy (Andersen, 1984; 
Letzring & Human, 2014; Letzring, Wells, & Funder, 2006). 
This may be especially helpful for less visible motives, 
which may partially explain why the associations between 
accuracy and friendship quality were, at least descriptively, 
stronger for motives than traits. Closer friends may also be 
more motivated to accurately perceive and express their 
motives to each other, which is likely to enhance accuracy 
(Biesanz & Human, 2010). Although the current study is not 
able to disentangle causality, this suggests accuracy in per-
ceiving a friend’s motives and friendship quality is likely to 
be closely, perhaps bidirectionally, linked.
Normativity and social desirability.  Viewing a friend’s person-
ality normatively was consistently associated with greater 
friendship quality, from both the perceiver’s and the target’s 
perspective. This is consistent with past work, which has 
found that more normative impressions are linked to greater 
liking (Human et al., 2018; Human et al., 2013). Thus, view-
ing a friend in a more normative manner may contribute to 
friendship quality, and greater friendship quality may also 
promote the application of normative knowledge.
However, these findings are inconsistent with work that 
has disentangled normativity from social desirability, which 
has instead found that whereas social desirability is posi-
tively related to liking, normativity is either unrelated 
(Rogers & Biesanz, 2015) or negatively related (Wessels 
et al., 2018; Zimmermann et al., 2018). Furthermore, in the 
current study, social desirability was not significantly associ-
ated with greater friendship quality for either traits or 
motives. However, the current sample was quite distinct 
from these past samples, involving dyads that were much 
closer to each other. Although we might expect social desir-
ability biases to be even more closely linked to friendship 
quality among closer dyads, given findings in romantic rela-
tionships (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996), perhaps there 
was a restriction of range in social desirability bias that made 
it harder to detect links with friendship quality.
Assumed similarity.  Viewing a friend as sharing a similar 
personality profile as the self was also quite consistently 
linked to greater friendship quality, in line with prior 
research (Human & Biesanz, 2011b; Human et al., 2013; 
Morry, 2007; Selfhout et al., 2009; Sunnafrank & Ramirez, 
2004). This emerged for both perceivers and targets, sug-
gesting that both assuming similarity and being seen as 
highly similar may foster greater friendship quality. Alter-
natively, it may be that people are more willing to assume 
similarity with or try to appear more similar to those with 
whom they enjoy relationships. Interestingly, these links 
tended to be somewhat stronger for motives than traits, per-
haps because assuming similarity on motives may more 
strongly promote a sense of interdependence in one’s daily 
pursuits and preferences than similarity on broader traits. 
Overall, as with accuracy, normativity and assumed simi-
larity on motives compared with traits appear to be at least 
as, if not more, closely linked to friendship quality, making 
it important to examine this dimension of personality more 
closely in future research.
Future Directions
A strength of the current research is that our sample was rela-
tively diverse in age and friendship length. However, the 
sample consisted mostly of women, so we could not ade-
quately test for gender differences. Our sample also con-
tained more same-sex than cross-sex friendships. Future 
work can also sample other cultural contexts (e.g., non-Mid-
western, non-majority White).
Having demonstrated that friends can perceive each oth-
er’s fundamental motives, motive perception in other types 
of relationships and social interactions should be explored. 
Some relationship and interaction partners may be more or 
less attuned to the detection of motives in general and some 
specific types of motives in particular. For example, an 
acquaintance might be better at recognizing affiliation or 
mate-seeking motives to determine whether the target is 
interested in socializing or seeking a romantic partner, 
respectively. In contrast, romantic relationship partners 
might be better at detecting relationship-relevant motives, 
such as mate retention or kin care motives.
Given that the current research was cross-sectional, it is 
also unclear whether friendship quality influences personal-
ity impressions, whether personality impressions influence 
friendship quality, or whether there are reciprocal associa-
tions over time. Future research should examine these ques-
tions longitudinally and/or experimentally to better examine 
the direction of these associations. Ideally, future work will 
also use other accuracy validation measures, such as infor-
mant- or behavioral-measures, as self-reports are just one, 
admittedly imperfect (e.g., Vazire, 2010), criterion.

## Conclusion

This study offers a foundation for studying accuracy in 
motive perception by providing evidence that friends can 
perceive each other’s fundamental motives accurately. 
Furthermore, greater accuracy was positively associated 
with friendship quality, above and beyond normativity, 
socially desirability, and assumed similarity. Accurate per-
ception of others’ motives may, in turn, facilitate goal attain-
ment, social cooperation, and intimacy. Yet, the current 
research also suggests that motive perception may be more 
challenging than trait perception, in part because motives 
tend to be more internal and therefore less visible to others. 
Future research should explore the factors that lead to 
improved and inhibited accuracy for motives.

Notes
1.	 One additional community sample dyad was excluded because 
one member disclosed that she had been drinking alcohol prior 
to the study.
2.	 The survey included other assessments, such as measures of indi-
vidual functioning and well-being, that are not examined here. 
These assessments are available here: https://osf.io/fhw34/.
3.	 In addition to friendship quality, we also examined the role of 
relationship length and created four items to assess perceptions 
and meta-perceptions of closeness (e.g., “How close do you 
feel to [name of friend]?”; see Stimulus Materials for Items). 
Friendship length was generally not significantly associated 
with impressions, except for accuracy for motives, all ps < .05, 
and all results presented below held controlling for friendship 
length. The pattern of results with the closeness items was highly 
similar to the Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS). We therefore 
focus on the results with the established FQS, although these 
additional variables and code to run these analyses are available 
here: osf.io/ns4h9/?view_only=0d1ccb89fd40486eb6a8783aa2
8a7fdd.
4.	 We also examined whether perceiver- and target-rated friend-
ship quality significantly interacted to predict greater accuracy 
but did not find any significant associations for traits, motives, 
or overall, all ps > .25.
