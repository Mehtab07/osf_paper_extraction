Summary of comparison between R Script Results and Research Paper Results:

Let's systematically compare the R script results summary ("code") with the relevant parts of the research paper's Results section ("paper"), focusing on:

1. Any mismatches between results reported and those computed.
2. Any missing results in either side.
3. Overall consistency and possible explanations if mismatches exist.

## 1. Direct Quantitative Comparison: MANOVA/NP-MANOVA Table

### Reported in the Paper (Table 1):

|           | DF  | SumSquares | MeanSquares | F. model | R2     | Pr (>F)  |
|-----------|-----|------------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Age > 85k | 1   | 3.337      | 3.3374      | 13.603   | 0.0326 | <0.0001  |
| Residuals | 404 | 99.121     | 0.2453      |          | 0.9674 |          |
| Total     | 405 | 102.458    |             |          | 1.0000 |          |

### Computed by the R Script (adonis $aov.tab):

|           | Df  | SumsOfSqs | MeanSqs | F.Model | R2      | Pr(>F)        |
|-----------|-----|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| age.gt.85 | 1   | 3.337     | 3.3374  | 13.603  | 0.03257 | 9.999e-05 *** |
| Residuals | 404 | 99.121    | 0.2453  |         | 0.96743 |               |
| Total     | 405 | 102.458   |         |         | 1.00000 |               |

#### **Comparison:**
- All values match to the 4th significant digit (DF, SumsOfSqs, MeanSqs, F.Model, R2, residuals, totals).
- P-value: Paper “<0.0001”, code gives “9.999e-05” (i.e., 0.00009999), which matches “<0.0001”. This is a reporting precision difference, not a substantive mismatch.

### **Conclusion:**  
**No mismatch.** The Results table in the paper accurately reports the adonis output from the R code.

## 2. Statistical Methods and Interpretation

### Code Details
- Method: vegan::adonis, formula = data.raw ~ age.gt.85, permutations = 10000, method = "euclidean"
- Output: coefficients for (Intercept) and age.gt.85 for various variables (X1, X2, X3, lake), and site coefficients.
- The permutation F distribution (f.perms) is included, showing F statistics from permutations.

### Paper Details
- States that a nonparametric multivariate ANOVA (NP-MANOVA) was performed using Podocarpus, Poaceae, Olea, miombo, charcoal, and lake level as proxies for the environment, testing before and after the 85 ka climate breakpoint.
- Reports the test and states significant difference in "variation and covariation" before and after 85 ka (i.e., the age.gt.85 group).
- States they used PCoA-transformed pollen to make it Euclidean and match the lake level variable.

#### **Comparison:**
- The analysis and test specification match exactly.
- The variables and transformation pipeline described in the paper (PCA, PCoA, NP-MANOVA) are consistent with the R code's call and summary.

### **Conclusion:**  
**No mismatch.** The implementation and reporting of the statistical method are consistent.

## 3. P-Value and Significance

- The R code gives Pr(>F) = 9.999e-05, marked as '***' (p < 0.001).
- The paper reports Pr (>F) as "<0.0001".

**This is a pure reporting convention (scientific notation vs. '<'). The paper rounds/substitutes the value for clarity.**

---

## 4. Additional Results: Interpolated Values

- The R script output includes interpolated values for age, various pollen taxa, lake, charcoal, and species richness at specific sample points (e.g., row indices 401-406, 2169-2174).
- The paper references interpolated and downsampled environmental proxies in its methods, and Figure 2 and 3 display such interpolated values.

**However, specific tabled values for interpolation do not appear in the main Results text, but are instead referenced in figures and supplementary materials.**

### **Are any interpolated values missing in either?**
- Code provides example interpolated rows.
- Paper shows only plotted (not tabular) data in main text, but says all data are available in Supplementary Materials.

**No clear mismatch.** The level of detail in the code is typically not presented in the main Results text but is referenced as available; the paper says "all data are available in the main text, cited references, or the Supplementary Materials."

---

## 5. Are Any Results Missing?

**From the Code but Present in the Paper:**
- The paper discusses Spearman’s correlation coefficients (Rs = 0.2542 and Rs = -0.2509) for charcoal and magnetic susceptibility, which are not shown in this R script output. However, those likely come from a different script or analysis; their absence here is not a mismatch unless this file was supposed to contain them.

**From the Paper but Present Only in Code:**
- The R code outputs coefficients for each site and sample, and the permutation distribution (f.perms) of F. These are not presented in the main paper text, which is normal for a scientific article.

---

## 6. Overall Consistency and Explanations for Any Mismatches

- **The core statistical result (NP-MANOVA/Adonis output, Table 1) matches exactly in all numerically relevant columns.**
- **Statistical significance reporting is consistent, with only minor reporting style variations.**
- **Methods and data processing as described in the paper match the code’s structure and outputs.**
- **Code contains extra detail (permuted F distribution, coefficients) not shown in the paper, but that's typical and not a mismatch.**
- **The only "missing" results are detailed site coefficients and permutation values, but these are not normally shown in the main text.**
- **No main results appear in the paper that are missing from this code, for the specific NP-MANOVA test.**
- **If the paper reports other statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman correlation), they are not covered by this R script, so absence is not an error.**

## **Conclusion**

- **There are no mismatches** between the results reported in the research paper and those computed by the R script for this analysis.
- **No substantial missing results**: all main findings in the Results section that depend on this analysis are supported by the code output.
- **Overall consistency** is excellent. Minor differences in reporting (e.g., P-value format, abbreviation of R2) are typical for scientific articles.
- **Possible explanations for differences**: Where the code provides more detail (e.g., permutations, site-specific coefficients), these are expected to be omitted from the main text for brevity or included in supplements.

## **Actionable Summary for Authors/Editors**

- The statistical analyses claimed in the Results section are **fully reproducible** from the provided code outputs.
- **No corrections or clarifications are needed** for the Results section, Table 1, or related text, with respect to this code.
- The supplementary data availability statement in the paper is accurate, given the code’s level of detail.

**If you desire a deeper check (e.g., for other statistical tests, other tables), those would require the corresponding code outputs.**
