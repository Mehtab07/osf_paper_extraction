Summary of comparison between R Script Results and Research Paper Results:

Here is a rigorous, evidence-based comparison of the **R script results summary** and the **results as reported in the research paper**, with attention to your three requested points: mismatches, omissions, and overall consistency.

## 1. Mismatches between results reported and those computed

### R Script Results Summary

```
[2025-05-06 14:38:46] [d4hjq] [R EXECUTION] File: d4hjq_src/02_parameter_estimation.R
[2025-05-06 14:38:46] [d4hjq] [R EXECUTION] Execution Successful:
[1] 71
[1] 1

[2025-05-06 14:38:46] [d4hjq] [R EXECUTION] ========================================
[2025-05-06 14:38:46] [d4hjq] [R EXECUTION] ⏳ Total execution time for project d4hjq: 1.04 seconds
```

- The script runs a file named **02_parameter_estimation.R** and outputs two numbers: **71** and **1** (from two consecutive `[1]` outputs).
- No error messages; execution is successful.

### Paper Results Section

- The Results section reports descriptive and inferential statistics about sentiment analysis (% positive/negative sentences), keyword frequencies, and the results of a t-test for sentiment differences between incumbents and opposition (with reported p-values: p = 0.04 for positive sentiment; p = 0.1 for negative sentiment, with one-tailed p = 0.05).
- The results also include detailed tables of data, e.g., the number of manifestos, years, sentences, percentages, and frequency analysis.

#### **Direct Comparison**

- **The outputs `[1] 71` and `[1] 1` do not appear anywhere in the text or tables of the paper.**
- There is no mention in the results section (or appendix tables) of a number 71 that could correspond to, for example, a parameter estimate, count, or statistical result (apart from frequency counts for words, but they are context-specific and not labeled as "parameter estimation").
- The script file name, **02_parameter_estimation.R**, suggests estimation of model parameters (likely for the t-test), but the output does not match reported p-values, t-statistics, or means.

**Conclusion:**  
There is a **clear mismatch** between the R script output (71 and 1) and any specific result reported in the paper's results section.

## 2. Missing Results in Either Side

### Results in the Paper but Not in R Script Output

- The paper reports:
  - Percentages of positive/negative sentences per manifesto per year and party
  - Changes in sentiment between elections
  - t-test results for differences in mean sentiment between incumbent and opposition parties, with specific p-values
  - Detailed keyword and frequency analysis tables

None of these results are present in the R script summary output (which only reports two numeric values, 71 and 1).

### Results in R Script Output but Not in the Paper

- The R script output of `71` and `1` is not explained, referred to, or contextualized anywhere in the paper.
- There is no mention of a "parameter estimate" with value 71 or 1.
- There is no explanation for the use of these numbers, nor are they used to support any statistical conclusion.

## 3. Overall Consistency and Possible Explanations for Mismatches

### Overall Consistency

- **There is a lack of direct correspondence** between the specific R script execution output and the results cited in the paper.
- The R script output suggests the running of a parameter estimation routine, but the only results surfaced are two numbers, which are not integrated into the reported analyses, tables, or narrative.

### Possible Explanations

1. **Reporting/Script Discrepancy**:
   - The script may not be the one that generates the published results. The numbers could be intermediary, diagnostic, or debugging outputs, not meant for inclusion in the final results.
   - The main analyses (sentiment calculations, t-test, keyword counts) may have been conducted in a different script or environment (possibly Python, as the paper focuses on Python-based NLP methods), and not in this R script.

2. **Omitted Context or Mapping**:
   - If the number **71** refers to a quantity used in the analysis (e.g., total positive sentences in a subset, or an intermediate calculation), the paper does not make this explicit, nor does it present the number in a way that would allow mapping.

3. **Update/Migration Issue**:
   - The execution date is in 2025, while the paper seems finalized in 2020, suggesting the script (and possibly the data or analysis workflow) could have changed since the publication.

4. **Reproducibility Gap**:
   - The paper claims full reproducibility and refers to an OSF repository, but the provided script and output do not allow replication of the main inferential findings (t-test p-values, sentiment means). This is a potential methodological problem, suggesting that the computational pipeline used for publication is either missing or not properly documented.

## **Conclusion**

**1. Mismatches:**  
The R script outputs (71, 1) do not appear in the paper’s results, and none of the paper’s reported statistical findings are present in the R script output.

**2. Missing Results:**  
The R script output omits all the key findings (percentages, t-tests, frequencies, etc.) detailed in the paper, and the specific outputs of the R script are not referenced or explained in the paper.

**3. Overall Consistency:**  
There is a significant **methodological inconsistency** between the code execution summary and the reporting of results in the paper. The output from the R script does not support, explain, or correspond to the evidence presented in the results section. The most plausible explanation is that the R script shown either does not correspond to the final analyses reported in the paper (possibly an unfinished or ancillary script) or that the main analysis was conducted in a different environment altogether.

**Recommendation:**  
For full methodological transparency and reproducibility, the authors should clarify:
- What the outputs `71` and `1` represent;
- Which scripts (and in what language/environment) generated the key findings reported in the paper;
- Ensure that the code and outputs provided correspond directly to the published results, especially the inferential statistics, to meet rigorous academic standards.

**In summary:**  
**There is a clear disconnect between the R script output and the results reported in the paper; the results are neither consistent nor mutually explanatory, and there are missing links in reproducibility and documentation.**
