The provided R script outputs and the research paper excerpt need a more complete dataset for a thorough comparison.  The R script shows results from statistical analyses (ADONIS and potentially others implied by file names), but the paper excerpt only shows some of the resulting numerical values, primarily focusing on p-values and R-squared.  A complete set of tables from the paper and the full R script output are necessary for a comprehensive analysis.


However, based on the limited information, I can offer a preliminary assessment:


**1. Numerical Results:**

* **Partial Match:** The R script provides an ANOVA table with an F-statistic (F.Model = 13.603), R-squared (R2 = 0.03257), and p-value (Pr(>F) = 9.999e-05).  The paper excerpt doesn't show these values explicitly for the same analysis, but it mentions statistical significance, suggesting a low p-value. This would need further examination.
* **Missing Data:** The R script outputs additional results (coefficients, coef.sites, f.perms, model.matrix). These are not directly comparable to the provided text from the paper without additional contextual information. The paper likely summarizes or presents these results in a different format (possibly within supplemental files)


**2. Missing Results:**

* **Potential Discrepancies:** The biggest potential for mismatches lies in comparing the R script's full output (including any additional analyses not shown) against the complete set of tables and figures in the research paper. Without access to the complete data, we cannot make a definitive statement on missing results.


**3. Methodological Consistency:**

* **Partial Verification:** The R script uses the `adonis` function from the `vegan` package for permutational ANOVA.  The paper mentions using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (NP-MANOVA).  The R script likely performs the PCoA as a preprocessing step for the MANOVA (indicated by the file names), but this requires verification with the full script and more detailed methodology section of the paper.
* **Incomplete Assessment:**  The paper details various other methods (OSL dating, phytolith analysis, etc.). These need to be assessed against the relevant sections of the R code for complete methodological verification.


**4. Statistical Significance:**

* **Inconclusive:** The R script reports highly significant results (***) for the effect of `age.gt.85` (p < 0.001).  While the paper discusses significance, there's no direct numerical comparison given in this extract.  A full comparison is needed to assess if the significance levels agree across all reported tests.


**In summary:** A proper analysis necessitates a complete dataset of the paperâ€™s tables and figures, including the supplemental materials, as well as the full R script to verify data consistency, check for missing results, and confirm methodological accuracy. The current preview only permits a partial and potentially misleading comparison.
